1
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,201
So, I looked at a bunch of houses,
and I think I've found the best one.

2
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,245
It's perfect. I'm gonna send you the link.

3
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,122
And then,
we should just go ahead and get it

4
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,373
'cause it's the best one.

5
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,208
<i>Abby, the house looks amazing,</i>

6
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,960
and the thought of a trip is exciting,

7
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,130
but turning 50 is so not a big deal to me.

8
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,467
I had a patient this week
who is in knots about turning 40.

9
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,803
The feedback I offered her,
as corny as it sounds, is:

10
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,889
"Age is truly just a number."

11
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,266
I mean,
you're only as old as you feel, right?

12
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,601
Why stress about it?

13
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,394
Fuck, that's hot!

14
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:02,771
I always love Hawaii.

15
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,231
You know what?
I catered Jack Johnson's birthday party,

16
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,691
and he said I could use
his beach house there.

17
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,777
Okay, here are my top picks: Napa...

18
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,404
a resort in Arizona, or Napa.

19
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,865
Well, all I can say
is thank God you're planning this,

20
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:17,368
'cause you know Brian is not
gonna do shit for her 50th.

21
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,829
You know Brian would just take her
to Macaroni Grill,

22
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,999
and then she'd have to drive home
because he had too much to drink.

23
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,209
Fucking Brian.

24
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,461
Oh, my God, this trip sounds so fun.

25
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,213
And it's so great
everyone can get together.

26
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,465
-You're coming, right?
-No.

27
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,384
Mama needs to rock out with her cock out.

28
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:37,222
Also, Mama needs to stop referring
to herself in the third person.

29
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,516
And maybe ease up on the cock drops.

30
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,102
I just want this to feel
like a regular vacation.

31
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,521
You know, like... just sit around, talk

32
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,981
and drink wine and laugh
and... wear muumuus...

33
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,943
And just somewhere in there,
I'll just kind of slide into 50.

34
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,195
You know,
I just want it to be super chill,

35
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,696
-no big deal--
-Die!

36
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,157
Brian, could you turn that down?

37
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,202
No, I'm sorry, Rebecca,
but it is officially a big deal.

38
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,371
It's your half-centennial.

39
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,665
I'm not gonna let this go by
without doing something big.

40
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,501
Okay... I'm gonna cut my bangs.

41
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,587
I really wanna make this work.
Honestly, I'm just so grateful

42
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,048
that you guys still want me to come
after I bailed on the last one.

43
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,136
God, it's just, like, the flying
and that random house, you know?

44
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,929
It just, like, gives me anxiety.

45
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,682
Other people's bathrooms... Oh, God!

46
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,600
Weird bedspreads...

47
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,727
You... do still want me to come, right?

48
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,522
Wall-to-wall carpeting, the remote...

49
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,275
You know what?
I wish I'd never seen that <i>Dateline</i>

50
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,402
with the blacklight
where they showed where the semen was.

51
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,905
Is a flower in the hair too much
for solo dining?

52
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,241
I need to get out
and take my new knees for a spin.

53
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,286
Val, yes, work those new knees!

54
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,621
-Out!
-<i>I just wanna meet a nice lady</i>

55
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:47,167
and I wanna make out for a while
and then spoon a little bit...

56
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,713
And then that spooning can turn
into a real spirited sixty-nining.

57
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,090
Have you ever tried a position
called the 1,000?

58
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,216
It's a sexy one.

59
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,802
It's when 1,000 kids are in your bed,

60
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:01,055
and the only touch you feel
is a tiny sweaty foot to the back.

61
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,100
Speaking of sexy,
I share my bed with a CPAP machine.

62
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,560
Things we say now.

63
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:09,898
I'm in H&M trying on some party clothes.

64
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,026
I can't wait to see you guys
and pinch all your butts...

65
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:13,985
with consent.

66
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,986
<i>See you soon!</i>

67
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,739
And, well, you know,
we'll figure out money when we get there.

68
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,657
Keep it in your pants till I see you.

69
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,451
Bye, I love you!

70
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,077
-What?
-No, I'm on the phone.

71
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,537
Bye, and remember,
don't make this a big deal.

72
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,415
-I just told my driver that I loved him.
-Somebody hang up.

73
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,043
All right, love you, guys, too. Bye!

74
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,461
Still not sure I'm coming.

75
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,374
Okay.

76
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,417
Here we are.

77
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,253
I hope it's perfect.

78
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,257
I don't know,
it had very good reviews online.

79
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,302
And let me tell you something,
I had to wade through a lot of shitboxes.

80
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,054
But this one is supposed to be good.

81
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,806
And it's supposed to have a pool.

82
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,015
Does anybody see a pool?

83
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,102
Oh, it is just stunning!
It's just so perfect.

84
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,689
-Just release all that worry.
-Or swallow it?

85
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,108
Okay, shall we?

86
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,693
Edible flowers!

87
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,111
I see that.

88
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,613
-Oh, my God.
-How do you know they're edible?

89
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,073
What? These are edible.

90
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,617
You wanna be the protector
and the caretaker and everything,

91
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,911
but... just let her deal with it.

92
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,456
-What the hell is she doing?
-Cannot let a stranger stay a stranger.

93
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,875
...you wanna take care of them,
and you wanna be the hero,

94
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,877
but sometimes you gotta back off,

95
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,796
let someone else in the family do it,
you know?

96
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,965
She's probably gonna invite him
to join us on the trip.

97
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,676
-Not, that that would be a bad--
-No, yeah, it would.

98
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,261
You take care of yourself.

99
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,890
And I really hope that your sister
is able to move your mom's grave.

100
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,310
And I'm gonna try the manicotti recipe.
Thanks.

101
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,186
Ready?

102
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,439
-To Rebecca!
-To Rebecca!

103
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:15,940
All right!

104
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,567
Thank you so much

105
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,651
for turning 50

106
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,112
-and bringing us all together.
-Yeah.

107
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,196
And thank you, guys.

108
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,157
I know you all had to move mountains
to make this happen.

109
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,243
-Especially you, Catherine.
-You know, life's a juggle, so...

110
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,745
I really appreciate it.

111
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,371
Rebecca really appreciates it.

112
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,751
Why am I speaking for Rebecca?
This is a terrible toast. I'm sorry.

113
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,587
I hope you guys like the house.
Let's get drunk. Happy birthday.

114
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,964
-Happy birthday!
-Cheers to us!

115
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,217
If I just may offer
a little bit of feedback,

116
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,763
I just want this to be a fun weekend
for all of us, right? Not just about me.

117
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,932
God, when was the last time
we were all together?

118
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,685
It was at Abby's wedding.

119
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,770
-What? No.
-Maybe.

120
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,606
You should have come to my divorce party.
There was a really great band.

121
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,149
-It wasn't that long ago.
-Jesus.

122
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,692
Nice one, kid.

123
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,235
Guys...

124
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,822
time goes by so fast, I'm telling you.

125
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,283
I have needed this... so much.

126
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,327
-You guys have been on my mind--
-Adrian, comma,

127
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,288
please resend the link to <i>Top Chef,</i>
period.

128
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,165
Can't open, period.

129
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,333
New paragraph.

130
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,294
Also, comma, please ask producers

131
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:22,006
how this show will be different,
question mark, dot, dot, dot.

132
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,883
I'm so sorry.

133
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,885
I have so much going on
with work right now.

134
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:26,844
I'm gonna unplug.

135
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,346
Be present, right.

136
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,140
Send.

137
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,726
Anyway, I made itineraries.

138
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,894
-What?
-I know.

139
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,396
And you don't have to read 'em now.

140
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,856
Just, you know, take your time,
but sort of like a...

141
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:43,653
loosey-goosey, you know,
sort of, like, scheduley thing.

142
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,406
Just sort of an overview
of everything we're gonna do

143
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,657
minute by minute on the trip.

144
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,952
-No worries, just take a look at it.
-This is so awesome.

145
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,746
-No presh.
-When did you have time to make those?

146
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,082
Well, I've been working a lot less lately.

147
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,708
-Yeah, right.
-Well, good for you.

148
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,626
Yeah.

149
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,962
We look so young.

150
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,880
God.

151
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:11,806
Wow.

152
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,689
Let's take a group picture.

153
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,399
-Yes.
-Yeah!

154
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,234
-Yes!
-We need a new pic.

155
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,195
-It's a night of a thousand selfies.
-Yeah.

156
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,489
-Can you go higher?
-Yeah, go higher.

157
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,408
-Try to go higher.
-All right, everybody look down,

158
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,493
and then on the count of three,
look up. Fresh faces.

159
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,411
Fresh face.

160
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,496
-One, two, three.
-One...

161
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,792
That's nice.

162
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,751
Wait.

163
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:41,752
What the...

164
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,296
Is that a ghost?

165
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,922
Oh, my God, it <i>is </i>a ghost.

166
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,217
It's the ghost of Amelia Earhart,
and she's holding a small baby.

167
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,595
-What are you guys doing in my house?
-Oh, my God.

168
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,637
Nah, I'm just goofing.

169
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,140
I'm Tammy, I own the place.

170
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,476
Brought you guys a cord of fresh pinyon,

171
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,977
get you started on a fire.

172
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,021
Thank you.

173
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,689
Guys, this is Tammy.

174
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,232
She's the owner of the place.

175
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,902
I'm Abby.
I'm the one that's been emailing you.

176
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,986
A lot of emails.

177
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,237
Yeah.

178
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,363
So...

179
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,241
which one of you guys
is the blushing bride?

180
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,911
Second time around I'm thinking, maybe?
Maybe third?

181
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,830
Oh, no. We're celebrating
Rebecca's birthday. It's her...

182
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,415
50th, the big five-oh.

183
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,834
Celebrating-with-the-girls weekend, huh?

184
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,712
We're just here for a vacation.
The birthday's not a big deal.

185
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,339
So, what am I looking at here?

186
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,258
High school tennis team,
old dance crew, or...

187
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,886
y'all magically fit
in the same pair of pants?

188
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,471
What brings us together?

189
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,473
Oh, well, we all met in Chicago

190
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,683
waitressing at a pizza place
called Antonio's,

191
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,436
and we just... It was meant to be.

192
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,314
Chi-Town? Yeah,
I've been to that place, yeah.

193
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,107
Well, we all came up there together
in the '90s.

194
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,025
Like, kind of our crew.

195
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,987
Actually, Catherine here started her own
pizza chain called Cutie Pies.

196
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,489
Holy shit, that's you?

197
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,241
Well, I've never been to the restaurant,

198
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,493
but I do love those frozen pizzas
for one that you do.

199
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,410
Thank you.

200
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,871
'Cause, you know,
if I prep a full-sized pizza, guess what?

201
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,957
I'm gonna end up eating a full-size pizza.

202
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,709
So, you know,
you prevent a lot of sadness.

203
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,295
So, do you guys want to see the house or--

204
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,547
-Yes.
-All right.

205
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,423
Let's stop dicking around.

206
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:13,177
You got the pool and the hot tub here
if you wanna soak...

207
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,804
or toke.

208
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,724
We are very discreet, so just...
do whatever the heck you need to do

209
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,601
-to get through this weekend.
-Okay.

210
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,521
So, Tammy,
how long have you owned the property?

211
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:24,981
-A few years.
-Yeah?

212
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,983
After my husband died, I sold our company.

213
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,776
We made edible organic soaps.

214
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,612
Got bought out by Unilever. Pretty sweet.

215
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,864
Sorry your husband died. That's sad.

216
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,076
Yeah, he died of a heart attack at 49.

217
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,786
-That's so young.
-That's terrible.

218
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,789
You think?
It was pretty inevitable, though.

219
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,457
We were doing so much blow.

220
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,918
This will come in real handy.

221
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:50,381
The little Zen area,
when you need that total soul escape.

222
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,343
It's real quiet. It's perfect
for when that roomie situation devolves.

223
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,096
You can just come out here
and watch the hummingbirds,

224
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:00,558
meditate,
enjoy this beautiful Buddha statue...

225
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,644
Now, this water feature over here,
steer clear, please.

226
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,856
Okay, you wanna know how much money
I poured into this son of a bitch?

227
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:11,193
Seven grand. And before you suggest it,
no, I cannot just turn it off.

228
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,404
If I do, none of the toilets will work.

229
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,447
Which is ironic

230
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,991
because it is basically a toilet
for birds...

231
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,367
and me that one time.

232
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,037
This is the firepit.

233
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,997
Light that sucker up,

234
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,583
stare into the flames and contemplate...

235
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,961
why in the hell you all came up here
in the first place.

236
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,339
Also, we have s'mores.

237
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,759
Hey, Tammy, I'm just having a hard time
getting on the Wi-Fi.

238
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,886
I just have to send
a quick e-mail for work.

239
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,888
Okay, yeah,
this is gonna be a rough weekend

240
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,598
if you have to do work stuff.

241
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,767
The Wi-Fi here is very slow.

242
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,978
So, you're just gonna have to talk
to each other.

243
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,397
-Oh, good.
-While drinking a ton of wine.

244
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,107
What could possibly go wrong?

245
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,943
Just remember, guys, whatever gets said,

246
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,946
it's probably
what the person has always felt,

247
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,823
and the alcohol just let it out.

248
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,828
You wanna see the view?
It's right through this gate.

249
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:10,211
Holy triple fucks, this is heaven!

250
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,129
Yeah, well, I didn't work my ass off

251
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,507
to buy a house
on some shitscape property.

252
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,675
-Wow.
-Yeah, that's fake.

253
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,468
There's no way that's real.
It's too pretty.

254
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,513
We should sleep out here one night,
under the stars.

255
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,431
-Yeah.
-You know, like a camping slumber party.

256
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,849
-Wouldn't that be fun?
-Yes!

257
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,685
Oh, God. Yeah, I don't wanna do that.

258
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,478
I don't know if I want to, either.

259
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,689
I have no place
to plug in my CPAP machine.

260
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,856
Things we say now.

261
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,485
What's everybody laughing at?

262
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,155
Oh, it's just like our, you know,
"That's what she said."

263
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,116
-You know, "Things we say now."
-Right.

264
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,075
So, like...

265
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,327
"I gotta go tend my bees."

266
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,745
Things we say now.

267
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,081
I guess.

268
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,792
Well, I say it,
'cause I got a bee farm, so...

269
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,210
You make honey?

270
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,878
No, I don't make honey.

271
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,338
I get stung a lot.

272
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,799
But you develop an immunity to it.

273
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,300
And almost a pleasure.

274
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,722
Well, you all obviously have
an entire haunted forest

275
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,183
of toxic jibber-jabber
to get through, so I'm gonna skedaddle.

276
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,310
-Okay, thank you.
-I have a question about the cleaning fee,

277
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,270
when you get a chance.

278
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,312
-Love it.
-See you.

279
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,273
-What else do bees do?
-All right.

280
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,359
Well, guys, you know what?
Even if we don't sleep out here,

281
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,696
I love Naomi's idea of just, like,
hanging out and drinking wine.

282
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,948
Just talking, connecting...

283
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,032
-Yes, totally.
-Love it.

284
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,077
We are gonna do all of that.
All of that is baked into the itinerary.

285
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,538
We're gonna lay around,
we're gonna drink wine,

286
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,290
but first on the docket:

287
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,876
"Unpack and unwind." For 20 minutes.

288
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,836
I'm setting a timer.

289
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,629
Psych. But, no. But...

290
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,714
I am...

291
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,340
Just take 20 minutes

292
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,593
'cause we have dinner reservations
at 7:15.

293
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:44,138
My God, she actually said,
"toxic jibber-jabber."

294
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,097
Yes, she did.

295
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,184
God, and what about those bees?
What, does she keep them as pets?

296
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,393
I gotta say something.

297
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,187
I actually really resent it when people,

298
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,106
especially other women,
automatically assume,

299
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,900
when they see a group of us,
that we're gonna fight.

300
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,235
-Yes.
-Oh, my gosh, when I was leaving the house

301
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:01,697
for this trip, Brian's like,
"Oh, have fun crying with your ladies."

302
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,948
I was like...

303
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,242
Anyway, you know,
he was just joking, of course, but--

304
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,702
Brian and his jokes.

305
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,954
-Yeah.
-I feel bad for Tammy, you know.

306
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,957
She clearly just hasn't had friends
like you in her life.

307
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,502
You know, we are so... lucky.

308
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,504
I love you turkeys so much.

309
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,964
-Oh, I love you, turkey.
-Love you, guys.

310
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,675
So, how much further is this place,
anyway?

311
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,220
Sorry, I thought
it was a little more walkable.

312
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,429
Oh, well, I mean, I'm good.

313
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,432
I got my comfy boots on, so...
No heels for me with my back.

314
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,769
You know you can heal your back
with your mind?

315
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,312
You know that's not true?

316
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,943
How you doing, Val, are you okay?

317
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,361
Yeah.

318
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,530
Oh, you should see
what these new knees can do.

319
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,823
Hold this for a second.

320
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:44,907
Check this shit out.

321
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,454
Holy... Wow, Val!

322
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,791
Oh, shit!

323
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,668
Keep going, Val!

324
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,127
We'll catch up!

325
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,178
-Cheers, dears!
-Cheers!

326
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,680
Love you.

327
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,931
-Cheers!
-Hello, ladies!

328
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,475
My name is Jade.
I'll be your server tonight.

329
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,477
-Hi Jade.
-Hi.

330
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,856
Jade, we're really hungry,
so we're gonna order really fast.

331
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,066
And we know what we want,
so maybe you should get some water,

332
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,985
and then I'll tell you
about our food allergies.

333
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,152
Okay, sounds good.

334
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,989
Thank you, Jade.
And we appreciate you, Jade.

335
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,074
No prob.

336
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,078
-Am I saying her name too much?
-Yeah.

337
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,956
Guys, I just heard myself talk. I'm sorry.

338
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,750
I know I get weird, bossy energy
on these trips.

339
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,169
-No, you're fine
-Oh, my God. Not even.

340
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,963
-Guys--
-You don't that much.

341
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,965
-You do not!
-I'm gonna try to rein it in.

342
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,384
I want this to go well,
and I'm afraid I'm gonna screw it up.

343
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,970
Honey, it's so fun.
We're having such a good time.

344
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,472
You know what?
That's just great self-feedback.

345
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:52,766
Thank you.

346
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,311
Why are you saying "feedback"
all the time?

347
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,897
It's this thing
I've been doing at my practice.

348
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,481
It just provides an emotional buffer.

349
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,276
So, rather than just launch
into "your take" on something

350
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,694
or just give advice, you say,

351
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,654
"May I offer you some feedback?"

352
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,572
Have you ever...

353
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,782
tried that feedback thing on Brian?

354
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,493
Well...

355
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,164
<i>May I offer you some feedback?</i>

356
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,167
<i>-Offer you some feedback</i>
<i>-May I offer you some feedback?</i>

357
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,879
<i>-Ready for some feedback</i>
<i>-Feedback</i>

358
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,466
<i>-Feedback!</i>
<i>-Ready for some feedback!</i>

359
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,717
That was good.

360
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,345
That is smoking!

361
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,972
-...on the side.
-I'll share this with you.

362
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:36,018
So, ladies, we have lavender popping corn,

363
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,395
and beside that, there's a <i>demi cruet</i>

364
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,315
of <i>fleur de sel</i>
for you to sprinkle on for a light zest.

365
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,652
-This is such an interesting combination.
-That's not enough.

366
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,028
So, where are you guys all from?

367
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,365
We're from all over.
I'm originally from Chicago.

368
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,742
-We all met in Chicago--
-Oh, nice, cool.

369
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,577
My ex-girlfriend just moved there,

370
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,829
so I'm a little mad at Chicago
at the moment, but...

371
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,666
All right, enjoy.

372
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,586
Did you hear the "ex-girlfriend" thing?

373
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,545
Jackpot.

374
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,048
Oh, sweet Jesus, I have service.

375
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,635
-Oh, yes.
-Oh, my God, yes.

376
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,721
Oh, no! They went bowling, you guys.

377
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,308
Adrian, comma...

378
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,812
Find out how long I have to decide,
period.

379
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:20,896
My cat took her pill.

380
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,816
I'm not understanding
this weekend deadline.

381
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,485
Question mark,
exclamation point, send.

382
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,990
Ladies, phones down.

383
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,492
Come on. You know what?
We should be looking at each other.

384
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,410
She's right.

385
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,369
Adrian, comma,

386
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,205
the pressure to make
a show decision is not--

387
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,541
I'm sorry. No, I'll stop.

388
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,458
No, stop!

389
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,460
Siri, no, I'm <i>dictating.</i> Dic--

390
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:45,879
Dick-tasting.

391
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,464
What the hell is that?

392
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:50,050
-She suggested "dick-tasting"?
-It's ridiculous.

393
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:55,431
-Rebecca!
-Guys! Not until Sunday!

394
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,100
I told you, I didn't want this to be
all about me this weekend.

395
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,143
Everybody!

396
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,521
<i>Happy, happy birthday</i>
<i>It's your special day</i>

397
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,732
<i>Have a slice of pizza</i>
<i>What's your favorite way?</i>

398
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,025
<i>-Hey!</i>
-What's your favorite way?

399
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,067
Mushroom and peppers.

400
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,195
<i>Mushroom and peppers</i>
<i>Mushroom and peppers</i>

401
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,407
<i>Mushroom and peppers</i>
<i>Mushroom and peppers, hey!</i>

402
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:14,742
-Jade.
-Yeah?

403
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,911
This is a song we used to sing
at the pizza place we used to work at.

404
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,413
Antonio's.

405
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,206
Antonio's, hey!

406
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,043
And long story short,
we're giving you a huge tip.

407
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,878
Hey, so what's
your favorite pizza topping?

408
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,379
-I'm a vegan...
-She's a vegan.

409
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,841
...so smoked tempeh and jalapeños.

410
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,178
<i>Smoked tempeh and jalapeños</i>
<i>Smoked tempeh and jalapeños</i>

411
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,765
<i>Smoked tempeh and jalapeños</i>
<i>Smoked tempeh and jalapeños</i>

412
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:38,724
Yeah!

413
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:42,686
Ho ho ho! Merry Vagmas!

414
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,396
-Merry Vagmas?
-And my name's...

415
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,606
Dilda Claus!

416
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,648
Oh, my!

417
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,984
Jolly old Saint Dick.

418
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,071
The first one that gets a gift...

419
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,532
the biggest gift, is Naomi.

420
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,160
-Thank you.
-Because she pushed out

421
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,829
four beautiful, big babies.

422
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,872
This is true, I--

423
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,875
So it's like ringing a bell,
right, Naomi? Enjoy.

424
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,753
It is. It's like a wet paper bag
down there. Thank you.

425
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,339
This one, I call the "hush puppy."

426
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,342
You can sit on this one in a coffee shop.

427
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,760
Oh, my God.

428
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,386
You there, Abby!

429
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,722
-Who, me?
-I have heard that you don't care

430
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,973
for a wasted moment.

431
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,975
-Wow.
-So, yours has a timer.

432
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,644
No!

433
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,897
Now, this one here is for you, Catherine,

434
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,358
and it's called "The Executive."

435
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,903
Make less deals and more squeals.

436
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:36,031
Don't turn your bedroom
into the boardroom.

437
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,327
This is for the <i>CE-Oh!</i>

438
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,497
Here we go.

439
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:49,086
Finally, the <i>pénis de résistance.</i>

440
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,256
-Look at this little soldier.
-Oh, no!

441
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,758
This is expensive,

442
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,845
and this is cheap as shit
from the dollar store.

443
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,264
So, remove hat before use.

444
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,767
It also vibrates to the birthday song.
Listen.

445
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,440
<i>Happy birthday...</i>

446
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,860
I mean, I don't wanna say it was
the best time of my life

447
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,862
'cause that's, you know, sad. But...

448
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,323
it was the best time of my life.

449
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,533
Well, life is real.

450
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,119
And we were like...

451
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,123
We were like sisters in the trenches.

452
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,208
Like, the pizza trenches.

453
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,627
-We were so brave.
-We were so brave.

454
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,218
Did you just burp or fart?

455
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,345
A little of both, I fear.

456
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,475
I love that necklace.

457
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,560
Oh, thank you.

458
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,855
It's vintage. From my vintage store.

459
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,691
-You have a vintage store?
-I do.

460
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,027
-And you live in Portland?
-I do.

461
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,695
Okay. Fuck, man,

462
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,031
you are officially the coolest person
I know.

463
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,784
Fuck, man, come to Portland.
There are so many of me.

464
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,870
I doubt that.

465
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,372
-You know what I'm scared of, though?
-What?

466
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,958
I hope these napkins aren't haunted.

467
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,131
That's amazing.

468
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,596
Oh, you're so fucking funny, I can't--

469
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,766
Oh, I'm funny,
that's how I... get the ladies.

470
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,601
I do a lot of napkin tricks.

471
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,894
Wait.

472
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,480
-Okay.
-Oh.

473
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,481
-I'm sorry.
-What?

474
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,942
-I have to do this. I'm an artist.
-Yeah?

475
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,443
Can I take your picture?

476
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,196
You just--
You look really good in this light.

477
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,113
-Really?
-Yeah.

478
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,866
-Sure, you can take my picture.
-Okay, great.

479
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,660
I'll take the glasses off.

480
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:45,744
Okay...

481
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,209
Check it. I put this...

482
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,379
-cool filter on it.
-Oh, that's really nice.

483
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,381
-Do you like it?
-I like that.

484
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,342
Here, I'll send it to you.
Put in your number.

485
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,635
Okay.

486
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,429
You're not gonna believe
who's in this restaurant.

487
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,265
-You'll never guess.
-Cher?

488
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,058
-No, guess again.
-Dua Lipa?

489
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,142
Who?

490
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,727
-Hillary Clinton?
-Better!

491
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,396
Childish Gambino?

492
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,605
ASAP Rocky?

493
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,524
Is that the one with the dollar sign S?

494
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,608
No, that's Ke$ha.

495
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,526
It's Keesha.

496
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,443
-Is it?
-Yeah.

497
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,154
-Holy shit, Keesha's here?
-No, ready?

498
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,282
Brené Brown.

499
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,534
Brené Brown?

500
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,868
Wait, who is Brené Brown?

501
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,705
Brené Brown, she did the famous TED Talk
about vulnerability.

502
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,790
She's a researcher-storyteller...

503
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,334
Shame, "courage is contagious,"

504
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,296
<i>Oprah's SuperSoul Conversations, </i>nothing?

505
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,882
-No, is she famous?
-Yeah, but she doesn't care about that.

506
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,884
Okay, that tracks, I get that.

507
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,053
We get famous people in here
all the time.

508

-Who?
-Future.

-Future?

00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,812
Is the past coming next week?

512
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,274
Holy shit, you guys, let's go meet Brené!

513
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,652
Let's not bug her.

514
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,779
Let's let her be.

515
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,742
Hey, Ms. Brené, we're so sorry
to interrupt your dinner.

516
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,453
-It's my birthday--
-Look at your skin. It's like marzipan.

517
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,413
We just have like ten or 15 questions
for you.

518
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,498
What's the difference between
braving the wilderness

519
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,792
-and <i>becoming </i>the wilderness?
<i>-</i>Comfort transformation...

520
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,669
How, when... and why?

521
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,839
How can I be generous
in my assumptions of others

522
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,758
-when I hate most people?
-Good one.

523
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,802
Here's the thing. We can't be generous
toward other people...

524
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,179
without boundaries.

525
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,847
-Yes, Brené, yes.
-Boom!

526
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,974
-Boom on the boundaries.
-So, boundaries.

527
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,643
-Boundaries, that means--
-Oh, my God. Message received.

528
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,188
-I'm sorry. I didn't even want to come.
-Got it, we'll come back later.

529
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,230
What a thrill.

530
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:40,275
<i>Give me your hand, darling</i>

531
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:44,321
<i>Do you feel my heart beating?</i>

532
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,616
<i>Do you understand?</i>

533
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,035
<i>Do you feel the same?</i>

534
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:54,748
<i>Am I only dreaming?</i>

535
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:58,126
<i>Is this burning</i>

536
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:04,508
<i>An eternal flame?</i>

537
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,260
<i>I don't know.</i>

538
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:14,768
Oh, fuck Ronald McDonald
for making Filet-O-Fish.

539
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,229
Fuck him ten ways from Sunday.

540
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:21,441
Everybody get their stretchy clothes on,
'cause we're gonna keep this party going!

541
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,660
Okay, ladies...

542
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:35,831
Gorgeous gaggle, sexy klatch, welcome...

543
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,417
to the next chapter of your evening.

544
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,294
Is it too early or too late
to have a next chapter?

545
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,798
-I feel like it's already tomorrow night.
-Hold up. What is that?

546
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,217
-What is that?
-Molly.

547
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,637
Okay, seriously, before you get all weird
and judge me and stuff like that,

548
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,807
I heard this super interesting podcast
on microdosing.

549
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,519
Do you know about this? Okay?
So, we take a really small amount of MDMA,

550
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,980
and, apparently,
it can create this common experience

551
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,690
that's, like, super bonding.

552
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,358
Okay, I'm listening.

553
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,862
Anyway, so...
we... are doing molly tonight.

554
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,073
I hear you,
but I don't think we are gonna do it.

555
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,867
So, we're gonna do coke?

556
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,952
No, it's like Ecstasy.

557
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,079
Like... MDMA.

558
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,623
I thought MDMA was that extreme fighting.

559
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,001
Wait, do they do coke and then they fight?

560
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,502
You guys, it's molly.

561
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,589
I mean, I wanna, yes-and this,
but I'm just wondering,

562
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,341
how does molly interact
with the drugs I'm currently taking?

563
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,011
'Cause right now, I'm on Levothroid
and melatonin.

564
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,972
-Things we say now.
-For reals, though.

565
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,558
I'm on Wellbutrin and Farxiga.

566
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,144
I think it's fine. I'm on Fluoxetine
and the Mirena IUD,

567
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,229
and I think it's gonna be totally fine.
I really do.

568
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,564
Guys, I'm on all kinds of stuff.

569
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,483
Zoloft, Singulair...

570
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:48,195
Raw Calcium,
black cohosh for night sweats, Zantac...

571
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,990
Mykonos, Who-you-gonna-call-trex,
Queef-a-tram.

572
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,535
Cath, I think what we're all trying to say
is maybe this isn't that kind of trip.

573
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,204
You know what I mean, like...

574
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:01,416
You know, we have a big day tomorrow,
and this is a marathon, it's not a sprint.

575
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,335
I thought it was a birthday weekend.

576
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,794
Well...

577
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,338
Oh, okay.

578
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,673
It's... totally...

579
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,383
It's Rebecca's birthday. Anyway...

580
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,136
you should download the podcast.
It's super interesting.

581
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,679
It's this amazing TED Talk, actually.

582
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,723
-It sounds amazing.
-I mean, I would do the podcast.

583
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,183
I'd love to listen to the podcast.

584
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:21,228
-I feel bad. I'm sorry.
-No, don't be sad.

585
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,521
-No, it's fine.
-Know what? Apparently,

586
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,648
we're just not that interested
in doing drugs.

587
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:28,276
Except for the thousands of drugs
we just listed.

588
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,237
I did Molly in college, but...

589
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,197
she went back to her boyfriend.

590
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,450
-Let's dance it out.
-Let's dance.

591
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:39,913
-Dance it out!
-Dancing's my job.

592
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,582
-What should our first song be?
-First song...

593
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,920
"Sweet Child o' Mine," Guns N' Roses,
then we'll cascade into "Paradise City."

594
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,297
Anything from the <i>Xanadu </i>soundtrack,

595
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,466
-anything from <i>Flashdance </i>soundtrack.
-Yeah.

596
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,051
I don't want any
Quentin Tarantino soundtracks.

597
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:53,969
-Never.
-I'm done.

598
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,646
Let's do a whole classic rock.

599
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,398
Let's do Boston, Styx,

600
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,733
Marshall Tucker Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd.

601
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,694
"Tuesday's Gone," no "Sweet Home Alabama."

602
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,404
Never. Kid Rock ruined it.

603
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,037
-Natalie Merchant?
-Natalie Merchant, yes.

604
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,373
-Lauryn Hill?
-Lauryn Hill, a hundred percent.

605
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,584
-Bless it. What happened to her?
-Yeah, I don't know.

606
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,502
She didn't pay her taxes. She went crazy.

607
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,306
I think we should not play anything...

608
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,890
later than "Hey Ya!"

609
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,560
-Nothing current.
-Nothing current.

610
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,437
-All right.
-Not tonight.

611
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,327
Do you know what?

612
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,664
I wished Prince's ghost...

613
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,167
would come back...

614
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,838
and... serenade me
for like two whole hours...

615
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,424
and then make sweet love to me.

616
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:15,800
Yeah, no shit.

617
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,095
He fucking glided

618
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,515
into that elevator in Paisley Park,
and that fucking door closed...

619
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:23,850
And then, poof.

620
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,477
Where's my baby?

621
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,313
-Where's my Prince?
<i>-</i>Beautiful-ass Prince.

622
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,607
I love my husband and shit, but, like...

623
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,193
that's the love of my life.

624
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,528
He had eyes like a beautiful newborn fawn.

625
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,530
What was his pain?

626
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,407
His hips.

627
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,450
Oh, God, yeah.

628
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,871
And who knows, you know? Life ain't easy.

629
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:45,789
No.

630
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:50,126
I feel like...
the universe is saying it to me.

631
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,753
I hear the universe saying...

632
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,673
"Your heroes are dying.

633
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,300
You're getting old."

634
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,345
-Dying is my worst fear.
-Same.

635
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,056
I swear to God. If anything....

636
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,392
happened to me...

637
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,646
I just think about my poor kids.

638
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,231
Like...

639
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,360
My babies.

640
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,738
-You know? Like, no one's...
-I know.

641
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,408
No one's gonna love my babies...

642
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:22,575
like I do.

643
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,495
They're your sweet peas.
But I'm gonna tell you something.

644
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,580
Remember, how Prince would throw
his guitar up in the air,

645
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,998
and his guitar tech...

646
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,335
would always catch the guitar
after a mind-blowing solo?

647
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,253
Yeah.

648
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,548
I'm... that person for you.

649
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,800
I'll catch your guitar. Every time.

650
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,677
I will always catch...

651
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:46,307
your motherfucking guitar,
'cause you... are my... rock.

652
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,685
I'm here for you. I'm your Apollonia.

653
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,854
I'm your Vanity.

654
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,856
-I love you.
-I love you.

655
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,316
Will you marry me?

656
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:57,902
Yeah.

657
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,705
<i>I want us now to actually take a look</i>
<i>at the word "microdosing."</i>

658
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:12,667
<i>"Mi." My experience, my emotions.</i>

659
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,171
<i>"C." I am now going to see.</i>

660
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,757
<i>I feel it in my emotions.</i>

661
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,592
<i>There are different lakes.</i>

662
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:25,555
<i>"Ro." Rowing your mental boat</i>
<i>down a different stream.</i>

663
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,253
Shit! Fuck! Who the fuck are you?

664
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,881
It's okay, I'm Devon.
I'm a nice person, I'm nice.

665
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,092
-I'm allowed to--
-What is that?

666
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:48,263
That's a squid...
for the paella I'm prepping.

667
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,641
Did Tammy not tell you
I come with the house?

668
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,936
No, she gave us the full download
on the toilet fountain,

669
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,813
but she forgot to mention you.

670
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,482
I don't know
what I was planning to do with this.

671
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,775
-What's going on?
-Oh, my God.

672
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,319
-Who is this asshole?
-This is...

673
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,907
-Who are you?
-I'm Devon.

674
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,909
I come with the house.

675
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,370
Think of me as your driver,
your tour guide, your chef.

676
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,122
I'm sorry I wasn't here,
by the way, yesterday.

677
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,374
I was down in Bodega Bay,
spearing this little guy.

678
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,126
Devon is making...

679
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,671
-What are you making?
-My famous paella.

680
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,923
Sorry, let me just grab this.

681
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,675
-Oh, God.
-It's kind of a process.

682
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,386
It takes a long time,
so I like to get a jump start on it.

683
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,222
Look at that thing. It's beautiful.
I mean, that is beautiful.

684
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:32,849
You hear that?

685
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:37,604
Squid or cuttlefish?
What do you think this is?

686
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,272
-God, that smells.
-It's a cuttlefish.

687
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,274
A cuttlefish is a little bit different
than their cousins,

688
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:44,569
but this has, actually,
what's called a cuttlebone inside of it.

689
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,405
And... squid is faster as a predator.

690
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,325
You're gonna see,
it takes on the flavor like a mother.

691
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,285
I mean, it's really sweet.

692
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,203
It wants to be flavored,

693
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,540
and it's actually
a more traditional seafood protein

694
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,667
to put in paella with the rice--

695
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,836
-Could you put that on ice, please?
-Yeah, absolutely.

696
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,422
Ladies, if there is anything
that you need, let me know.

697
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,381
Anything at all.

698
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,883
Because, as always...

699
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,471
it's an amazing day in wine country.

700
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,056
No, it's not.

701
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,308
Oh, yeah, Devon, can you do me a favor?

702
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,517
Can you help me...

703
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,479
with the wind chimes
over the ceramic frogs?

704
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,357
'Cause they're all tangled
in the dream catchers,

705
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,942
and the sound has been keeping us up
all night.

706
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,444
God damn it. I'm so sorry.
Sleep is so important.

707
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,073
-Show me.
-There was a really loud bird out here.

708
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,783
So sorry to hear. I'll shut these later.

709
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,534
Do you have a key, or how did you get in?

710
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,244
Hey, how we feeling, ladies?

711
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,044
I feel like hot garbage.

712
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,505
Should we make coffee?

713
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:47,715
Yeah.

714
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,219
What the fuck is this?

715
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,639
That's...

716
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,809
That's seafood from... Devon.

717
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,478
-Who's Devon?
-He comes with the house.

718
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,779
Do we...

719
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,783
-hit the button?
-Gotta push the button.

720
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,537
-Should I push the button?
-Or I could do it.

721
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,625
Wait, did you already take a shower,
or are you about to take a shower?

722
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:24,961
What?

723
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,255
I don't know.

724
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,013
Does this house have a tea thingy? Like...

725
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,599
You know what I mean, like...

726
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,936
Like a hot water source.

727
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,647
-A kettle!
-Kettle.

728
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:45,565
A kettle.

729
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,316
Man, I am not doing great.

730
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,820
Yeah, what did I say last night?

731
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,948
I feel like I went on and on
about... somebody's mom.

732
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,534
Oh, wait, did everyone hang out
after I went to bed?

733
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,661
Are there any inside jokes
I should get caught up on?

734
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,996
No, we all went to bed.

735
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,583
Devon breaks in at 7:00 a.m.,

736
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,877
-but now he rings the doorbell?
-Who's Devon?

737
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,836
He comes with the house.

738
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,213
It's the tarot card reader.

739
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:10,840
The what?

740
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,051
-Oh, no!
-On the itinerary.

741
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,763
Maybe she can get the coffee to work.

742
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,765
Her name's... Lady Sunshine.

743
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,850
Hi, you must be Lady--

744
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,019
This house was impossible to find.

745
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,104
Not marked.

746
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,190
I'm a psychic, not Magellan.

747
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:28,691
Oh, boy.

748
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,402
Okay, when I figure out
where I'm gonna place myself,

749
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,780
I'm gonna need you to put this somewhere
where I can see it.

750
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:34,697
Okay.

751
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,615
No.

752
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,410
We're gonna have to smudge
the heck out of this space.

753
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,788
The juju <i>es no bueno.</i>

754
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,124
Honey, take this...

755
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,711
and go all around the room with it,
really wave it around.

756
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,590
-Don't be shy.
-Okay.

757
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,928
Okay, smudging not working.

758
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,138
We're gonna have to go
to a different room.

759
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,599
One that is not contaminated.

760
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,559
-Preferably...
-Just let it go...

761
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,311
if I may offer some feedback.

762
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,814
<i>Are you ready for some feedback?</i>

763
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,065
Oh, no.

764
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,983
Are you a singing group?

765
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,069
No, just friends.

766
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:18,866
We'll see.

767
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,494
The Chariot.

768
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,249
Oh, my God,
that would make a beautiful tattoo.

769
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,671
The Chariot is a very positive card...

770
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:32,797
Oh, really?

771
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,216
...when it's right-side up.
Yours is upside down.

772
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,510
The upside-down Chariot...

773
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,763
tells me that you're being dragged
through time with no control

774
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,682
over where life is taking you.

775
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,976
A big change has upended you.

776
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,978
You're free-falling.

777
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,981
You're killing yourself staying busy,

778
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,858
because if you don't, you feel...

779
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,610
as if you will literally break apart.

780
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,905
It'd still make a killer tattoo.

781
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:00,908
Who's next?

782
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,579
That's not good.

783
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,416
The Five of Pentacles.

784
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:12,628
Many say this card signifies
financial loss, poverty.

785
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,673
Well, I'm lucky
'cause I'm very comfortable,

786
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:19,260
but I do have an opportunity
I would love to ask you about.

787
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,221
It's... a TV job.

788
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,932
I wonder what the card says about that.

789
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,351
May I continue?

790
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,270
Yeah, of course.

791
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:33,107
Many say that this card signifies
financial loss, poverty.

792
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,901
-Okay.
-But not me.

793
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:35,818
She flipped it.

794
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:40,072
I find that the Five of Pentacles points
to <i>emotional </i>poverty.

795
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,994
So, nothing about the TV show?

796
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,208
The Fool.

797
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,336
You want a tattoo of this one as well?

798
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,757
I liked the Chariot better.

799
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,427
The Fool represents new beginnings,
optimism.

800
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,430
Man, I'm really ready to meet somebody.

801
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,808
Well, the Fool has difficulty seizing
on new opportunities

802
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,436
because they're too focused
on the needs of others.

803
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:14,398
Are you saying I should put my knees...

804
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,901
before others' needs?

805
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,033
They laughed.

806
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,618
Next.

807
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,331
The Devil.

808
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,876
The Devil represents the violent forces
of nature

809
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,045
that can strain you-- Where did she go?

810
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,713
I don't think this is her jam.

811
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,548
I don't think this is anyone's jam.

812
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,385
Death.

813
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,762
-Fuck me!
-Jesus Christ!

814
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,515
-You're fired!
-No, I love this card,

815
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,559
because people always think
that this is a very negative card.

816
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,062
They're scared of it.
But the Death card actually indicates

817
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,814
a time of transformation.

818
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,942
The death of the old you
to make way for the new.

819
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,777
A metamorphosis.

820
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,654
You're ready to become a butterfly.

821
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,782
But it can also mean death is coming.

822
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,494
Okay.

823
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,207
The Wheel of Fortune.

824
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,751
Wheel... of...

825
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,379
-For--
-The Wheel represents life cycles.

826
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,172
A turning point.

827
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,634
-The big change is coming.
-Her 50th birthday.

828
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,386
Half a century.

829
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,222
That's a long time.

830
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,266
Fifty years of age.

831
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,602
And see how Lady Fortuna
is just standing here,

832
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,646
in the middle of this wheel of change?

833
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,440
-She is unmoving.
-All right, yeah.

834
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,484
Right. Tranquil, peaceful.

835
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,653
Over, done.

836
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,115
And now, for the group reading.

837
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,784
You know, no.
I think this is when we say goodbye.

838
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,369
-Yeah, I'm doing--
-I've gotta...

839
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,829
-Yeah, we're done.
-Me, too.

840
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,708
Yeah, you're right. Never mind.

841
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,376
Wait, why? What does it say?

842
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,378
Is it bad?

843
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,590
The garden looks like a winner.

844
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:06,802
Usually, yes, but not when it's sandwiched
between the snakes and the rocks.

845
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,680
You see, the fighting snakes show me...

846
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,475
that you all surround yourselves
with battles.

847
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,146
People who have been intertwined
and dueling for thousands of years.

848
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,984
You need to help shed the tough skins
that have built up over time...

849
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,028
if you are to remain friends.

850
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,863
A lot of secrets.

851
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,366
Many things unspoken.

852
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,950
And you see the space?

853
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,994
No one's as close as they think.

854
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,705
And you see here, with the river stones?

855
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:39,168
They're gems. They used to be dynamic
and many-faceted.

856
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,379
And they have been worn over time.

857
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,548
And now, they're smooth and dull...

858
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,342
aged.

859
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,180
From one old lady to another...

860
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,766
get over all your shit,

861
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,352
'cause it is later than you think.

862
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,738
That'll be $475.

863
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,742
<i>Hello, this is Olivia</i>
<i>from Dr. Melton's office</i>

864
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,744
<i>calling to let you know that the results--</i>

865
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,122
Move it or lose it. I'm up.

866
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,082
Got it.
Don't wanna fuck up that itinerary.

867
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,500
We got our marching orders.

868
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:20,960
Hey, oh.

869
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,842
Sorry, is this any better?

870
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:31,220
So, what's going on with the offer?
Is it any-- Hello?

871
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,097
Hello?

872
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,683
Shitballs! Hello?

873
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,518
-Hello? Shit, fuck!
-Sorry.

874
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,938
Not being nosy, just wanted
to bring some of my hangover cure.

875
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,648
Oh, thanks.

876
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,484
Oh, and some of my edible soaps
for you, too.

877
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,527
Sorry, I...

878
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:50,489
I know I should be enjoying myself
and not stressing about work.

879
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,116
Hey, I'm not judging.

880
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:57,037
Owning and managing five properties
has its share of shit-fuck days for sure.

881
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,458
But I bet you get to meet
a lot of interesting people, so...

882
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,128
No. No, you'd be surprised.

883
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,504
People are all the same.

884
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,341
I go whole days without speaking.

885
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,262
Better get to the wine tasting, so...

886
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,640
A little advice for today.

887
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:20,394
If you or anyone around you
starts a sentence with:

888
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,022
"Can I just say something?"
stop right there.

889
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,982
Okay, I will keep that in mind, thank you.

890
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,233
Try the juice.

891
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:36,702
It's got kind of a garbage flavor,
but the soap helps with the aftertaste.

892
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,788
-Edible?
-Seventy percent.

893
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,088
I can still taste the soap a little bit.

894
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,966
It's just in your head.
It's 'cause of the shape.

895
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,552
Now, as you can see,
this little beauty is quite spacious

896
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,639
and does come
with four-by-four off-road capability.

897
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,058
So, if you see some beautiful spot,
and you say to yourself:

898
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,227
"I'd like to get up close and personal
with that vista,

899
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,522
but the terrain is clearly a no-go,"
think again. I got you.

900
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,065
Yeah, we got it, man.

901
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,442
This van has everything here.
We've got seats like...

902
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,945
-Who is this guy again?
-Abby's worst nightmare.

903
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:14,240
...cup holders,
really nice adjustable air and fan,

904
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,408
safety lights, emergency kit--

905
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,369
Okay, let's get driving.

906
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,788
We have a birthday we need to celebrate.

907
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,333
How old are you turning, little mama, 21?

908
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,710
Devon, it's none of your business.

909
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:30,214
No, you know, I'm not ashamed to say,
actually, I am turning 50 tomorrow.

910
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,049
Yeah!

911
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:35,177
Great, yeah... You say it, sister!

912
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,595
Okay, can we go?

913
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,555
All right.

914
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,183
<i>Birthday to you</i>

915
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,978
<i>Your birthday</i>

916
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:50,526
Overshot it. I hear things a touch sharp.

917
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,361
Devon, let's go.

918
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,404
-Yeah. Here we go.
-Okay.

919
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:57,074
Hold that for a moment, would you?
All right, 10-4, captain.

920
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,287
So, ladies,
a little early history of the Napa Valley.

921
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:05,708
The first official winery and vineyard
was established by one Mr. John Patchett,

922
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,627
who began planting grape vines in 1854--

923
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,879
So, Val,
did that cute waitress text you back?

924
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,924
-Is there romance in the air?
-Devon, don't listen to our conversation.

925
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:16,218
No, but she's probably still sleeping.

926
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,804
That picture she took of you is gorgeous.

927
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,097
-Thanks.
-What picture?

928
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,600
Oh, it's on the shared photo site we have.

929
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,226
You probably didn't accept the invite.

930
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,477
No, I didn't get one.

931
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,605
Would you send me a invite? I'll accept.

932
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,774
-Probably just the Wi-Fi.
-Signal is hard to come by out here.

933
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,443
I'll tell you what's not hard to come by:

934
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:36,071
a rich and hearty Cab Sauv
with healthy levels of tannins.

935
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,240
Which brings me back
to John Patchett in 1854--

936
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,659
I do not wanna learn about wine
on this trip.

937
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:41,869
This is weird, Cat.

938
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:42,995
You're not on here.

939
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:46,123
Way to go, guys.
Who started the shared site?

940
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,792
Oh, I did,
but I didn't intentionally leave you off.

941
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,629
Remember, let's remain uncontaminated

942
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:54,006
from Lady Sunshine's negative suggestions.

943
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,841
-Amen.
-Yes, we are uncontaminated.

944
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:58,260
Uncontaminated. All right, added.

945
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,012
Hey, should we listen to some tunes?

946
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,848
-Let's do DUI songs.
-Yes!

947
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,600
You guys got DUIs, too?

948
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,935
No, it's a game we play.

949
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:10,022
It's like guilty pleasure songs we blast
when we're tipsy.

950
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:13,192
Are you... legally allowed to drive?

951
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,193
I will be.

952
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,031
-Yes.
-Yeah!

953
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:24,953
...less than 4.04% of the wine in America.

954
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,288
Devon, shh!

955
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,874
<i>Looking out a dirty old window</i>

956
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:32,961
<i>Down below the cars</i>
<i>In the city go rushing by</i>

957
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:39,593
<i>I sit here alone and I wonder why</i>

958
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,139
<i>Friday night and everyone's moving</i>

959
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:48,227
<i>I can feel the heat, but it's soothing,</i>
<i>Heading down</i>

960
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:53,941
<i>I search for the beat in this dirty town</i>
<i>Downtown</i>

961
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,193
<i>The young ones are going</i>

962
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,737
<i>Downtown, the young ones are growing</i>

963
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:02,282
<i>-We're the kids in America</i>
<i>-Whoa</i>

964
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,160
<i>-We're the kids in America</i>
<i>-Whoa</i>

965
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:08,330
<i>Everybody lives for the music-go-round</i>

966
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:21,343
Ladies, if Cabernet Sauvignon
is the king of wine country,

967
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:24,346
Chardonnay is its queen. It's bold--

968
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,640
Okay, hair of the dog.

969
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,934
All right, fine, go to a wine store, then.

970
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,228
I just wanna say...

971
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,523
that we never know
where life is gonna take us.

972
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,066
So let's live for today...

973
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:39,194
and party till our panties fly off.
Wait, where is Catherine?

974
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:42,281
I think she had to call her agent.
Please don't say "panties."

975
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,324
Oh, hell to the hell to the no!

976
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,534
I'm gonna go get her.

977
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,873
Anyone picking up on the notes
of honeysuckle?

978
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,417
-Yeah, sure.
-Get a good sniff.

979
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,336
Let me know what you smell.
There's no wrong answers.

980
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:57,963
Green apple?

981
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,215
-Yes.
-Yes, very good. Green apple.

982
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:05,137
I wanna say... canned peaches?

983
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,222
No.

984
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,475
You said there's no wrong answer.

985
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,185
Yeah, but... you know.

986
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,062
Peaches, there's no peaches in there.

987
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:15,981
-Okay.
-What else you got?

988
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,109
-Oh, lemon.
-Yes, very good.

989
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,569
I taste the lemon, yeah.

990
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,196
You don't taste it, you smell it.

991
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,363
Grapes.

992
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,407
Well, yeah... of course.

993
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,284
Nice, that's smart!

994
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,369
-Definitely grapes in there.
-Can't go wrong with that.

995
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:33,999
-Jasmine.
-No, that's... egregious.

996
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,709
Pinot-gregious.

997
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,046
-Thank you.
-You're killing it!

998
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,590
Oh, we lost Mason.

999
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,467
So, is it like<i> The Catherine Stewart Show,</i>

1000
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,969
or is it like I'm one of three judges,
you know what I mean?

1001
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:50,265
'Cause that's sort of significant
in terms of what... I'm talking about.

1002
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,017
You know what I mean?

1003
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,770
Right,
if it's <i>Catherine Stewart of Cutie Pies</i>

1004
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:57,648
or <i>Cutie Pies featuring Catherine Stewart,</i>
and, like...

1005
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,192
Can you hold on one second?
Something's going on in front of me.

1006
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,861
-What are you doing?
-My God, give me my phone back.

1007
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,739
-That's an important phone call.
-My face is an important phone call.

1008
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,075
I'm not giving you
your precious phone back...

1009
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,911
until you start flossing.

1010
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:11,995
Come on.

1011
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,038
All right, fine.

1012
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:15,833
<i>Do it</i>

1013
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,085
Okay, oh, my God, I'm nailing this.
I'm really good at this.

1014
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,171
-She'll call you back. She's flossing.
-I gotta floss more when I'm day-drunk.

1015
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,923
Here's the last thing I sent to her:

1016
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:26,718
"I have vintage jade earrings at my store.
Would love to send them to you."

1017
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,303
So dumb.

1018
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:33,100
She's Jade... you know?
She's got like a million jade things.

1019
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,476
I made a mistake.

1020
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,895
She's too young for me.

1021
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,397
Val.

1022
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,108
May I offer you some feedback?

1023
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,484
Go for it.

1024
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:46,780
Okay, I mean, when it comes to age,
the number itself truly doesn't matter.

1025
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:47,823
It's, I mean...

1026
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,659
I wish Abby could understand this,
'cause she's coming at me like,

1027
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:51,994
"You're 50!" It's like,

1028
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,872
what matters is how you feel inside, so...

1029
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:59,751
with all that in mind,
what would you say your soul's age is?

1030
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,837
I'd say, like, 12.

1031
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:06,341
I mean, maybe a little older.
Probably old enough to drink... and bone.

1032
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:09,094
Maybe 18, 18 and a half.

1033
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,722
Almost out of the house.

1034
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,433
Don't have my own car yet.

1035
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,184
But I have a bike.

1036
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:20,939
-This one's good. What's it called again?
-White wine.

1037
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,107
Fricking love it!

1038
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,775
So, can I just say something?

1039
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:27,279
Rebecca is in complete denial
that this is her birthday weekend.

1040
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:29,907
You know, as usual,
she's glossing over everything.

1041
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,451
There's so many things
she doesn't deal with.

1042
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:35,579
-Hello, Brian.
-Fucking Brian.

1043
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:38,123
She's gotta be having feelings
about turning 50.

1044
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,917
Where does she put it all?

1045
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,420
"This is just another trip,
it's not a big deal." It's like...

1046
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,922
Hello? Get into it!

1047
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,591
God, you know how hard it is,
by the way...

1048
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,802
to make 10,000 reservations for 400 people

1049
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,472
at 55 million different locations?

1050
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:57,559
I know. Abby, you've done such a good job
at planning this. You should know that.

1051
00:48:58,769 --> 00:48:59,603
Thanks.

1052
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,481
It's probably
'cause it's my full-time job now.

1053
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,107
Wait, what?

1054
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:07,110
-This is good, right?
-Oh, yeah.

1055
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,157
Chug-a-lug, ladies, we're on the move.

1056
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:15,619
Oh, no, ladies. That is a select Cabernet,
meant to be savored...

1057
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:18,413
Yeah, well, we can get this stuff online.
Let's hit the van.

1058
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:23,835
-Jeez, this is a real go-go-go kinda trip.
-Keep up, 50.

1059
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,296
My soul age is 28.

1060
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:29,424
I'd love to get your names and socials
for our wine club.

1061
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,386
Okay, guys, next stop is biking
and shopping...

1062
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,929
-Yes!
-...and we're gonna get all of our stuff

1063
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,223
in Napa so we don't have to get anything
at the airport.

1064
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:39,643
-I'm gonna buy a really big hat.
-Naomi, you're up, what's your DUI song?

1065
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:44,398
My song is gonna be,
"Poison, Po-po-po, Poison."

1066
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:04,668
Pizza.

1067
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,135
Oh, my gosh.

1068
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,639
I just spent $750.

1069
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:23,687
Not only is Morgan Jorng Winery solar,
it is also...

1070
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,231
organic!

1071
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,942
So no sulfates, no pesticides,

1072
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,987
and the beautiful sun powering us all.

1073
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,823
You'll notice, because it's organic,

1074
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:37,409
there's a lot of sediment
at the bottom of your glass.

1075
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:40,287
-I was wondering what that was.
-Does anybody know the term for that?

1076
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,373
For the sediment
at the bottom of the glass.

1077
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,418
-You can just tell us.
-Sediment?

1078
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,503
-Gravel?
-Mud?

1079
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,174
-Shavings?
-Wine waste?

1080
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,926
-Minerality?
-I'll just go ahead and answer this one.

1081
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,554
-Tartrates.
-Tartrates.

1082
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,890
You know what I also like to call it,
though?

1083
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,016
Wine diamonds.

1084
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,561
Jeez, people really like to talk
about wine around here.

1085
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:05,562
Well, yeah.

1086
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:07,564
It's Napa.

1087
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,444
Right? Why you came here.

1088
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:15,739
-Can we... get to the...
-Sure, get to the solar questions?

1089
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:16,948
No, speed this up.

1090
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:22,496
Okay, so, how much energy do you think
that our solar panels create here?

1091
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,414
-How much energy?
-I don't know.

1092
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,458
Ten kilowatts?

1093
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:27,834
Fifty thousand.

1094
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:29,878
-Right.
-I was way off.

1095
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,797
You know what I really like
that we do here?

1096
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,216
Notice how our wines are not on ice?

1097
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:35,342
What are they on?

1098
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:38,428
-Soil?
-Soil. Exactly. I...

1099
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,847
-We're gonna stroll around for a second.
-Oh, okay.

1100
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:44,267
So, just one rule today:
no walking in the vineyards.

1101
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:45,936
Okay?

1102
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:47,771
And have fun.

1103
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,689
Can I just say something?

1104
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,901
I'm tired of Naomi shaming me
for working all the time.

1105
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:56,404
You know what I mean? It's like, we work.
It's who we are, it's what we do.

1106
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:01,118
Well, I hope I'm more than my work,
or else, fuck.

1107
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,244
Come on, yeah.

1108
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,496
Okay, let's play "path not taken."

1109
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,833
I would work at a bookstore,
like a crunchy bookstore

1110
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:11,128
in Portland or Seattle,
somewhere rainy and moody.

1111
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,420
-I love it.
-Right?

1112
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:13,713
-That's so good.
-You go.

1113
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,216
Okay, path not taken. Zamboni driver.

1114
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:19,386
I swear to God. It would be so peaceful.

1115
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,138
Clean slate every two hours.

1116
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,348
Start over, nice and simple.

1117
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,976
Really cold, no hot flashes. Come on.

1118
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,645
I think I would also be good
at close-up magic.

1119
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,480
-You would.
-Thank you.

1120
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,233
-Oh, my God, that's such a good one.
-Yeah. I could...

1121
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,110
-maintain fierce eye contact...
-Yes.

1122
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:36,987
-...while stealing someone's wallet.
-I love it.

1123
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,655
Can I just say something?

1124
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:41,074
Why is Naomi treating this trip like...

1125
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,160
we're all gonna die immediately after?

1126
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,453
She loves us so much.

1127
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,539
But, yeah, it's a little manic.

1128
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,083
Is there scarecrows out here?

1129
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,044
'Cause if I see a scarecrow,
I'm gonna fucking shit my pants.

1130
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,008
Remember when you shit your pants
in Yankee Candle Company?

1131
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:01,636
Yes. Because whenever I sniff candles,
I always have to poop.

1132
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:05,599
Yeah, but you're around candles,
so it covers up the smell. That's good.

1133
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,643
I know, but then, it's a vicious cycle.

1134
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,062
<i>Can I just say something?</i>

1135
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,982
I got my bikini area lasered,

1136
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:18,069
and now I'm like, "Oh, great.
What's it gonna look like when I'm 70?"

1137
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,738
Is it going to be like a...

1138
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,324
gray-haired goatee?

1139
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,535
-You got too much off?
-Yes. It's like...

1140
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,829
It's like pencil-thin, I blew it.

1141
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:30,999
-I'm gonna need that hair down there--
-You don't know.

1142
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:34,586
Maybe it'll be a cute little
Colonel Sanders chin going on down there.

1143
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:39,090
That's what I want,
a cute Colonel Sanders chin.

1144
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:42,844
"Honey, are you looking forward
to seeing Colonel Sanders tonight?"

1145
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:44,179
Oh, boy.

1146
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,932
Maybe it's like a...
you know, it's like a...

1147
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,602
like a Dizzy Gillespie,
like a jazz musician...

1148
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:51,895
-Oh, right.
-...beav.

1149
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,980
-I think he'd love that.
-What about a little Ted Nugent?

1150
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,607
No, wait, I shouldn't have said that.

1151
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,817
-Fuck that guy.
-No. No Ted Nugent. Sorry.

1152
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,111
Like a Billy Bob Thornton,
that's what you were thinking.

1153
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,238
Sure, Billy Bob Thornton.

1154
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,782
"Hey, honey, you want
some french fried potatoes?"

1155
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,163
Oh, God! Full-on mud in this bottle.

1156
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:12,415
God, fuck this organic shit.

1157
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,792
Well, you better drink up,

1158
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:16,753
'cause Abby's gonna come through
with the Abby alarm any minute now.

1159
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,588
-Oh, my God.
-Can I just say something?

1160
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,882
-She needs to ease up.
-Yes.

1161
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,009
-It's insane.
-Hi!

1162
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:26,972
This is an organic winery,
so we can't have you walking in there.

1163
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,057
-Oh.
-Yeah, I think we put up signs.

1164
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:30,976
Right there.

1165
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:33,478
So, yeah, can't walk through there.

1166
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:36,064
-Sorry.
-Okay, you can follow me out.

1167
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:38,316
-Okay, sorry about that.
-Okay.

1168
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,819
-Sorry, not sorry.
-Right?

1169
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:43,697
-The sign is facing the other way.
-Hey, guess what? Passive-aggressive.

1170
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,158
-That wasn't passive. That was aggressive.
-Guess what, also?

1171
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,119
-My shoes are clean.
-Yeah.

1172
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,997
Hey, you don't know me.
You don't know my shoes.

1173
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,582
-You don't...
-You don't know my shoes, bitch!

1174
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,001
You don't know my shoes!

1175
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:58,128
Guess what? These are fucking clean.

1176
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:00,338
Can you just follow me out? Yeah.
Keep coming.

1177
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,590
-Okay, no problem.
-Okay, sorry about that.

1178
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,599
<i>-Happy birthday, babe.</i>
-Technically tomorrow.

1179
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,351
-He knows that.
<i>-But I can't call tomorrow</i>

1180
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:16,187
<i>-'cause I'll be out on the pontoon boat.</i>
-Holy shit.

1181
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:19,399
Have they been here this whole time?

1182
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,070
Hey.

1183
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,911
I know, guys.

1184
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,581
You were thinking something else, right?

1185
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,458
Well, guess what, I'm here.

1186
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:42,756
Funny story,
I had some wine diamonds today,

1187
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,758
and I don't feel so good.

1188
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,719
Oh, my God. Naomi is loaded.

1189
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:50,597
You know, I wanna sing a little ditty

1190
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,351
for my sweet, very short friend Rebecca

1191
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:58,271
who is turning 22 tomorrow.

1192
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,397
Wink, wink.

1193
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,317
She's not.

1194
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,277
You know...

1195
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,029
birthdays are a funny thing,

1196
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:08,698
'cause, like, some people hate 'em,
and some people love 'em.

1197
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,450
I love my birthday, I'm a Leo.

1198
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:15,413
But, Rebecca, you got it going on, girl.

1199
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,584
Don't get it twisted.

1200
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,128
You deserve the world.

1201
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,839
And since I can't give you diamonds

1202
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:26,716
and I can't give you pearls,

1203
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,387
I'm gonna give you something
you ain't never had before.

1204
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,848
I'm gonna give you a song from the heart.

1205
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,934
You guys,

1206
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,019
our dear, sweet...

1207
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:41,272
Rebecca Sue is all grown up.

1208
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:45,276
I want to dedicate this song

1209
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,363
to my beautiful friend Rebecca.

1210
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,990
This is for you, honey tits.

1211
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:53,368
Hit it, boys.

1212
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,328
What would you like us to play?

1213
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,163
"Eternal Flame."

1214
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,790
-Okay.
-Yes.

1215
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:06,881
<i>Close your eyes</i>

1216
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,092
Oh, my God.

1217
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,635
Naomi?

1218
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:12,846
I'm cool.

1219
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,347
Yeah!

1220
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,224
You're a pro.

1221
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:17,308
<i>Darling</i>

1222
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:21,312
<i>Do you feel my heart beating?</i>

1223
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:26,901
<i>Do you understand?</i>

1224
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,364
I'm sensing a lull.

1225
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,491
So my vote is for literally anything
by Sublime.

1226
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,659
Absolutely not, Devon.

1227
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,036
-Chilis?
-Devon, no.

1228
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,830
-Bush?
-Now I'm getting upset.

1229
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:41,416
Oh, my God. "Everything Zen."
That changed my life.

1230
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:42,959
-Third Eye Blind?
-No.

1231
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,294
-311?
-No.

1232
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:47,922
Okay, guys! I got the T-shirts
for the drone shot.

1233
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:49,966
Did you say "drone shot"?

1234
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:52,427
Oh, yeah, the drone shot.
It's in the itinerary.

1235
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,054
Yes, I said "drone." On the itinerary.

1236
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,640
-I don't think my shirt's gonna fit.
-It is. It will.

1237
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,142
Okay, follow me, guys. Let's go.

1238
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:01,102
Can we stay here a little bit?
It's so nice.

1239
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,480
We're gonna go through the wine tunnels
and take the drone shot.

1240
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,940
Holy cannoli.

1241
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:08,693
These weird wine caves
would be a good place to try molly.

1242
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:11,946
Maybe we'll do the molly after we get
the drone shot. That'll be more fun.

1243
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,949
Wait, I have a few more questions.
Is molly what that kid did

1244
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:17,243
when he ate that guy's face
in his dad's garage?

1245
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,370
-No, I don't think so.
-Is that the one that keeps you up?

1246
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,206
Because when I need to sleep,
I need to sleep.

1247
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,750
Come on, people, let's just try it.
What are we, a bunch of nerds?

1248
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,544
-Yes.
-Okay, if we want to do the molly,

1249
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,671
maybe we can do it
after horseback riding tomorrow.

1250
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:33,009
-I vote "no" on the horseback riding.
-Wait, here's what I don't get.

1251
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:35,428
If we were to do the molly,
how long does it stay in your body?

1252
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,639
Like, what is the duration of the "trip"?

1253
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:40,141
Oh, my God, with the quotes.

1254
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,393
Whatever we do,
we have to harmonize in here

1255
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,729
-'cause the acoustics are the shit.
-Oh, yes.

1256
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,616
Hey, guys? Can we put our T-shirts on,

1257
00:58:56,866 --> 00:59:00,078
so we can get to the pavilion
and take a super fun drone shot?

1258
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:06,960
You guys, I'm gonna go follow her,
and I'm gonna offer her some feedback.

1259
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,796
-I actually think that's a terrible idea.
-I wouldn't do that.

1260
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,881
-Please don't.
-This is what I do.

1261
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,508
Where is she?

1262
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:17,303
Yeah, how does she know her way
around these tunnels?

1263
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:20,723
<i>-Where'd she go?</i>
<i>-Where'd she go?</i>

1264
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,518
<i>-Where'd she go?</i>
<i>-Where'd she go?</i>

1265
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:27,605
<i>Where did she go?</i>

1266
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,359
Seriously, where did she go?

1267
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,904
-Are we lost?
-We've gotta find her.

1268
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,015
Hey, Abby?

1269
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,642
The girls urged me
not to offer you any feedback,

1270
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,603
but I'm just gonna go with my gut here.

1271
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,271
May I offer you some feedback?

1272
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:09,522
Oh, boy.

1273
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:13,526
I feel like the universe
is gently nudging you to chill.

1274
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,945
Well, tell the universe that I'm chilling

1275
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,364
and I'm also looking for the drone.
Do you see it?

1276
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,575
Okay, just, the schedule you have us on,

1277
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:23,036
I feel like it's keeping <i>you</i>
from having fun.<i> </i>Like,

1278
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,623
if you were just to let go,
everything will just fall into place.

1279
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,208
Will it fall into place?

1280
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:32,170
Will it, Rebecca? Will it fall into place?

1281
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,589
Will someone else take care of me?

1282
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,758
Or will I always have to do
everything myself?

1283
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,052
Let me know when it falls into place,

1284
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:42,013
'cause last time I checked,
this world's pretty fucking selfish.

1285
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,640
Okay. Deep breath.

1286
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:46,559
No, let's take some inventory
about how everything's falling into place.

1287
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,062
How about my marriage?
Did that fall into place?

1288
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,230
What about this text from that girl
that's gonna hurt you?

1289
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,398
That falling into place?

1290
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:56,361
Your obvious midlife crisis.
Is that falling into place?

1291
01:00:57,195 --> 01:01:00,114
Your inability to cope
with almost everything?

1292
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,283
-Is that falling into place for you?
-No.

1293
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:05,161
-Your husband? Is that falling into place?
-What?

1294
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,664
Maybe you should take a good hard look
at yourself in the mirror.

1295
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,248
Maybe the therapist should go to therapy.

1296
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:15,046
Am I not getting a falling into place?

1297
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:16,964
Jeez, Catherine, enough.

1298
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:20,093
The whole "left out" thing
is really getting old.

1299
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:23,054
You're the one who's always running away
from us every time you get a call.

1300
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:25,348
-I have work.
-I'm sorry, let's not fight.

1301
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,892
This time together
is supposed to be special.

1302
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:30,687
Oh, my God, Naomi, we're not fighting,
we're just talking.

1303
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,856
-That's what life is.
-Well, it's very negative.

1304
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,025
Yeah, well, life is negative.
That's what Brené Brown said.

1305
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,111
That's exactly what she did <i>not </i>say.

1306
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,363
Abby, what is negative in your life
right now?

1307
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:42,615
You've got amazing friends,
you got a great career--

1308
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:43,991
No, I don't.

1309
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:45,785
Okay? I lost my job.

1310
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:49,706
All right? And it's really stupid
to even cry about it.

1311
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:55,586
Shit, I mean, people are starving
in the world, and there's earthquakes.

1312
01:01:56,087 --> 01:02:00,007
And people are shooting at each other,
and I'm crying about my stupid poor job.

1313
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:03,177
Abby, honey. That doesn't mean
your feelings aren't valid.

1314
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,346
That's exactly what white privilege is!

1315
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,682
Plus, what are we doing
to the environment?

1316
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:09,767
I mean, we can't--
There's no fish anymore!

1317
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:10,768
All the plastic is...

1318
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,438
filling up in the ocean.

1319
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:17,483
And... there's like one rhinoceros left!

1320
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:20,528
What the fuck?

1321
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:26,200
Why wouldn't she tell us that?

1322
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,122
Some things are too scary to say.

1323
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,415
Not to us.

1324
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,752
You guys don't like Brian?

1325
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:38,921
-Oh, my God, we love Brian.
-Brian, he's the best.

1326
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,757
-He's a character.
-He's so cool.

1327
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,425
-Fucking prince.
-Awesome.

1328
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:49,640
Where to?

1329
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,603
Well, Abby, what's on the itinerary?

1330
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:56,314
You know what? Don't look at that.
It doesn't matter. It's stupid.

1331
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:05,156
Do you think throwing the itineraries
out the window was on the itinerary?

1332
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:06,532
Guess we'll never know.

1333
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:09,494
Guys, left or right?
I gotta make a decision.

1334
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,706
Oh, my God, she texted.

1335
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:15,792
Jade just texted back.

1336
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:19,003
She wants us to come over to her art show.

1337
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,006
I told you.

1338
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:25,259
-I mean, I knew that she would text.
-Okay, let's go there, then.

1339
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,553
Let's go to the art show, right?
That'll be perfect.

1340
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:28,888
Let's pick a DUI song!

1341
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,057
Anybody?

1342
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:33,434
-Abby?
-Silence is good for now.

1343
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:54,080
This is a major fuck-up.

1344
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,706
Abby's gonna hate this.

1345
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:59,293
This wall of shoe boxes
should really snap her out of her mood.

1346
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,304
I'll tell you the answer.

1347
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,265
"No" and "No, you're not."

1348
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,476
Abby, I know you don't want
to talk about it,

1349
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,396
-but I'm really sorry about your job.
-Well, thanks.

1350
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:21,399
The one time I can't figure out
how to get on Snapchat.

1351
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:22,358
One time.

1352
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:23,985
And everybody saw.

1353
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:28,614
Young people blow.

1354
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:35,663
Isn't Jade so ungodly cute?

1355
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:42,670
Okay, guys,
I'm gonna just say a couple words.

1356
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:45,965
Yeah, so...

1357
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,551
Art has been my <i>raison d'être</i>

1358
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:51,804
since... literally my first moment
of consciousness.

1359
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:58,019
I... can't believe I'm following
in the footsteps of my heroes.

1360
01:04:58,185 --> 01:05:01,606
O'Keeffe, Kahlo, Warhol, Basquiat,

1361
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,608
with my very own show.

1362
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,320
So, thank you. I'm humbled.

1363
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:09,238
Clearly.

1364
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,658
Thank you for coming in, too...
like, from the city,

1365
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,535
with the caravans and all of you,

1366
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:17,997
it's... fucking so touching.
So, thank you.

1367
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,542
So, yeah. Let me get on with it.

1368
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:25,129
<i>The Nanny</i> was more than a sitcom.

1369
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:29,216
Okay, it was a post-modern psychodrama

1370
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:32,345
about classism and ambition in the 1990s.

1371
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:36,974
You know, Fran Drescher's Fran Fine
was an icon.

1372
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:40,394
Honestly, I mean, a cultural touchstone.

1373
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:45,066
God. All her art is Fran Drescher.

1374
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:47,276
Why?

1375
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:51,572
Yeah, so yeah, I'd like to just open up
for some questions or comments.

1376
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:52,490
Yeah?

1377
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:56,827
It's so contextual, but at the same time,
wholly independent.

1378
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:58,704
Did you do that consciously?

1379
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,748
You know what? I did, yeah.

1380
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:04,168
It's really a<i> lettera d'amore</i>
to <i>The Nanny.</i>

1381
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:07,838
But, more importantly, it's a reaction
to all of our experiences

1382
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,716
-surrounding <i>The Nanny.</i>
-I never saw <i>The Nanny,</i>

1383
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,095
but I don't want that to stop me
from participating in this conversation.

1384
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:15,054
It shouldn't.

1385
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,891
This piece. Am I supposed to feel scared?

1386
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,686
Yes. I am so glad you got that vibe.

1387
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:25,064
-Also offended. Yeah?
-Very. Thank you.

1388
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,316
Have you considered doing
any other sitcom art?

1389
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,236
-Like, is <i>ALF </i>an option?
-That's a good question.

1390
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,947
I think I'm focusing more on women
right now.

1391
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:36,367
'Cause, I don't know,
I feel like time is up on <i>ALF, </i>right?

1392
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:37,910
I have a question.

1393
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:41,497
Do any of you watch TV?
Like, is TV still a thing?

1394
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,874
Like, do you watch
those judging competition shows?

1395
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,751
I've only seen TV in the movies.

1396
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,963
I knew I was right.
Dammit, gotta call my agent.

1397
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:53,300
Adrian, comma, confirming I was correct

1398
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:57,138
re, colon, streaming V, period, broadcast.

1399
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:59,181
Shit, I don't have a signal.
I gotta go outside.

1400
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:04,186
Yeah, my oldest kid is 15,
and on the verge of becoming...

1401
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:06,063
this.

1402
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:10,067
I just wanna know, how do I stop her
from becoming an asshole?

1403
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:12,653
I feel like I'm about to take umbrage.

1404
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,196
Are you okay?

1405
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,032
And you know what else worries me?

1406
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,284
It is way too easy for you guys
to get porn.

1407
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:19,493
Oh, my God.

1408
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,496
I used to drive miles
in the middle of the night

1409
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:25,124
just to go to this little newsstand
by the bus station

1410
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:26,959
just to find lesbo porn.

1411
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:29,879
You guys have it so lucky
on the porn front.

1412
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:33,591
I hadn't thought about it
that way before. It's so interesting.

1413
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,594
No wonder they're so scared of sexuality.

1414
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:38,846
They associate it with hard work and fear.

1415
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:40,973
And driving long distances.

1416
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,017
I can't with the confidence
in these people.

1417
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:43,934
Wait.

1418
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:46,729
So we're putting 'em down
because they have healthy self-esteem?

1419
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:49,315
I've spent my whole life thinking I suck.

1420
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,650
You know what happened
at my first poetry reading?

1421
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:52,902
I completely bombed.

1422
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:56,197
No claps. No snaps. Just total silence.

1423
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,449
Till, finally, this one dude,
way in the back,

1424
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:01,660
he just turned to his girlfriend
and he went, "Oof."

1425
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:04,872
But you know what?
That was an important "oof,"

1426
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:08,334
because it confirmed to me
that I'm a complete piece of shit.

1427
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:10,544
And that's what made me the writer
I am today.

1428
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,463
I thank God for that "oof."

1429
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:15,633
-This girl needs an "oof."
-Oof.

1430
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:19,303
Jade, we're not trying to hurt
anyone's feelings.

1431
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:21,180
My God, they were born with hurt feelings.

1432
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:25,017
Why don't you not blast your feelings
all over your best friend, the internet?

1433
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,811
Please,
their parents are their best friends.

1434
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:28,145
Well, that I do like.

1435
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,689
You know who my best friend is?
My best friend.

1436
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:33,692
These women, right here,
who I've known for 20-plus years.

1437
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,862
And yeah, sure, sometimes I want
to tell this one to fuck off.

1438
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,656
That's what intimacy looks like.

1439
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:40,491
-You want me to fuck off?
-What?

1440
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:42,993
If you all are friends,
why are you so mad at each other?

1441
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:44,286
We're not mad.

1442
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,539
-Crazy, mad, grouchy. Look at this one.
-Fascinating.

1443
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:48,707
We're not grouchy.

1444
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,209
Guys, please forgive us.

1445
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,044
We've been drinking wine all day,

1446
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,421
and we're just not right in our heads
right now.

1447
01:08:54,505 --> 01:09:00,719
We are exactly where we need to be.
We're doing <i>fine. Fran Fine.</i>

1448
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:04,890
That's brilliant. Did you see that?

1449
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,392
Is this part of the show?

1450
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,937
That was... incredible.

1451
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,606
You are amazing. Moms, you're amazing.

1452
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:18,696
Context within context,
that's exactly what we're talking about.

1453
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:37,131
Excuse me. Do you have Wi-Fi in here?

1454
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,175
And then there was one.

1455
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:41,302
Tammy, hi.

1456
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,513
I'm just trying to get a little work done
while the girls are at this art show.

1457
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:45,681
-Art show?
-Yeah.

1458
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:47,808
Oof, things must have gone
really sideways.

1459
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,518
-Yeah.
-Give me your phone.

1460
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:52,104
-I'll get you online.
-Oh, my God, awesome. Thank you.

1461
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:55,816
Pedro,
is the password still "penisgrigio72"?

1462
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:01,322
Thank you.
We need a couple of beers here also.

1463
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:02,948
Cool.

1464
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:05,117
Are you guys good pals?

1465
01:10:06,243 --> 01:10:07,411
We are acquaintances.

1466
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:12,750
Do you ever get lonely up here,
living by yourself?

1467
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:16,962
No, I love it. Loneliness is for suckers.

1468
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:19,256
'Cause you know who I can trust? Me.

1469
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:22,384
You know who's never gonna bail on me?
Me.

1470
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,345
Anyway, get your shit done,

1471
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:26,680
bring people joy
with that fantastic pizza.

1472
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,641
I'll be over here hitting bull's-eyes.

1473
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:34,313
-Can I ask your advice on something?
-Shoot.

1474
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:37,942
-I'm being offered this TV show.
-No, shoot the dart.

1475
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:41,403
I'm uncomfortable in any one-on-one
situation unless I can win.

1476
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:45,407
Sure. Right, okay.

1477
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,952
Thanks, Val.

1478
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,871
Do you think you can carry this one
over, too?

1479
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:51,956
You got it.

1480
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:54,416
Okay, just be very careful.

1481
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,584
-Oh, of course.
-Okay.

1482
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,963
Oh, that smile is so infectious.

1483
01:10:59,129 --> 01:11:01,131
I know, it's so ironic, right?

1484
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,262
Sorry about my friends.

1485
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:08,764
Oh, no! I love them.

1486
01:11:09,473 --> 01:11:12,434
People are really liking my show!

1487
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:15,938
Do you think you guys could come back
and do that whole,

1488
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:17,982
"I'm mad at young people" thing again?

1489
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,441
I can ask.

1490
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,444
But to be clear,
we're not mad at young people.

1491
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:24,738
Or I'd be mad at myself, right?

1492
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,118
You're so funny, Val.

1493
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:31,203
I'm happy we met.

1494
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:32,579
Me, too.

1495
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:35,666
I like you.

1496
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:40,337
I like you, too.

1497
01:11:47,344 --> 01:11:48,804
Can I ask you something?

1498
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:57,146
I think I know what it is.

1499
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:05,863
I usually charge 800, but...

1500
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,282
I'm gonna give it to you for 600.

1501
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,665
Talking about the painting?

1502
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:22,296
That's great.

1503
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:25,924
'Cause I love your art so much.

1504
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:28,719
-It's gonna look great.
-I can't wait to hang it.

1505
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:29,678
So happy.

1506
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:38,312
As a business owner, you can't join in
in the same way.

1507
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:42,358
You know, you can't worry
about if people like you or not.

1508
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:44,985
Yeah, I mean, I...

1509
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:46,945
Shit.

1510
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:49,448
I get that with my employees,

1511
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,700
but we're talking about my oldest friends.

1512
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:54,828
I mean, of course I'm gonna be worried
about what they think.

1513
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:58,123
-That's where you're fucking up.
-Why?

1514
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:02,628
Because I don't think your friends
even invited you on this trip.

1515
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:04,254
Did Abby tell you that?

1516
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:06,298
Did she say five people were coming?

1517
01:13:06,423 --> 01:13:07,257
What? No.

1518
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:10,302
Well, I'm saying work is a big part
of who you are.

1519
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,846
So if they don't let you talk about work,

1520
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,391
then they're not letting you be
on this trip.

1521
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:17,518
Yeah, okay. Can I just say something?

1522
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:19,353
No. Remember what I said?

1523
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,605
About the phrase
"Can I just say something?"

1524
01:13:21,688 --> 01:13:23,857
-Just walk away from that phrase.
-Fuck, right.

1525
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:28,821
When I was a kid,

1526
01:13:30,322 --> 01:13:31,698
I was always alone, you know?

1527
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:35,786
My mom was a single, working mother,
that whole deal, right?

1528
01:13:36,328 --> 01:13:39,206
And it really wasn't
until I met these girls that I...

1529
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,708
experienced family.

1530
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:43,836
That's powerful.

1531
01:13:44,461 --> 01:13:45,838
Friendship is powerful.

1532
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,717
You gotta do that show.

1533
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:54,888
Stay busy, pizza for one.
Be honest with yourself,

1534
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:57,975
work is your best friend.
And you gotta get contestants on that show

1535
01:13:58,058 --> 01:14:00,769
that are kids,
because I love watching kids with knives.

1536
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,149
Yeah.

1537
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:17,035
This weekend is a mess.

1538
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:20,664
I can't even plan a fun birthday trip.

1539
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:24,126
Can I quote one
of my favorite song lyrics?

1540
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:27,045
"Self-doubt is self-worth

1541
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,505
in another universe."

1542
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:32,134
What song is that?

1543
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:33,635
My own.

1544
01:14:35,095 --> 01:14:35,971
Of course.

1545
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:39,349
Is the paella ready yet?

1546
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:41,518
Just about,
maybe another four hours or so.

1547
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:42,561
Oh, Jesus.

1548
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:46,106
-How are you gonna get that thing home?
-I don't know. I'll fucking fold it.

1549
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:47,483
You know what?

1550
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:51,236
Today was <i>not </i>an amazing day
in wine country.

1551
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:53,739
So, suck on that.

1552
01:14:59,369 --> 01:15:03,290
<i>-So how is it? Are you having fun?</i>
-This trip is three nights too long.

1553
01:15:04,082 --> 01:15:07,211
<i>But the trip is only three nights.</i>
<i>Oh. I get it.</i>

1554
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:10,631
I wish I was there.

1555
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:13,967
<i>Hello, this is Olivia</i>
<i>from Dr. Melton's office</i>

1556
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:16,845
<i>calling to let you know that the results</i>
<i>from your blood work are in.</i>

1557
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:19,681
<i>If you could please give us a call back</i>
<i>at your earliest convenience...</i>

1558
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,636
Fuck!

1559
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:00,430
Oh, my God.

1560
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,099
Oh, my back!

1561
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:06,103
My back!

1562
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:10,857
Oh, no.

1563
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:13,527
Oh, my God, no.

1564
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:16,738
Guys!

1565
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:22,077
Hey.

1566
01:16:22,327 --> 01:16:24,705
So, quick update,
the paella is still simmering.

1567
01:16:24,788 --> 01:16:26,873
It's gonna take a little longer
than I thought.

1568
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:28,000
Whatever, Devon.

1569
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:39,845
Any chance we could have sex?

1570
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:06,747
Fine.

1571
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:16,089
Good morning, sunshine.

1572
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:20,427
I'd love to stick around and snuggle,
but the paella is probably peaking.

1573
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:21,887
Devon, get the fuck out.

1574
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:23,055
To be continued.

1575
01:17:27,517 --> 01:17:28,560
Rebecca?

1576
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:32,230
What's going on?
Are you okay? Did you pass out?

1577
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,733
No, I'm not okay.

1578
01:17:35,108 --> 01:17:37,361
-I threw my back out.
-Oh, no.

1579
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:40,238
-Okay, let me call Tammy.
-No, Naomi, shut up, shut it.

1580
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,490
-Okay.
-Just help me up here.

1581
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:42,407
You got it.

1582
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,326
-Okay, just get me up.
-Okay, you got it.

1583
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:46,703
-Okay, ready? One, two, three...
-No problem.

1584
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:51,124
Oh, honey.

1585
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:52,501
Are you okay?

1586
01:17:53,126 --> 01:17:54,378
I was lying here all night.

1587
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:56,546
And I realized...

1588
01:17:57,297 --> 01:17:58,548
Abby was right about me.

1589
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:01,677
I did need to take a good hard look
in the mirror,

1590
01:18:02,135 --> 01:18:04,179
or in this case, the door.

1591
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:06,598
And as I was lying here,

1592
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:08,934
I saw every truth about myself.

1593
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:10,394
Soon,

1594
01:18:10,977 --> 01:18:12,854
a trio of raccoons joined me.

1595
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:14,481
Right there.

1596
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:16,400
Yeah.

1597
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:19,069
I locked eyes with the dad.

1598
01:18:21,154 --> 01:18:23,365
Once you've looked
in the eye of a raccoon,

1599
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:25,659
you know your truth.

1600
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,912
How did you know he was the dad?

1601
01:18:29,162 --> 01:18:31,164
He was just the leader, I could tell.

1602
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:33,083
But you didn't, like, look at--

1603
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:36,586
They were all with me, though.
They stayed here. It was amazing.

1604
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,506
-You saw a family of raccoons?
-Yes.

1605
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:41,508
And you communicated with them?

1606
01:18:41,591 --> 01:18:43,802
I connected with them
more than anyone this whole weekend.

1607
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,638
Honey, did you take that molly?

1608
01:18:47,347 --> 01:18:49,015
They helped me see what I really am.

1609
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,893
-An old lady.
-What?

1610
01:18:52,352 --> 01:18:54,646
Yes, it's true. I'm old, 50!

1611
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,606
-That's half a fucking century.
-Listen...

1612
01:18:57,232 --> 01:19:00,902
we are all getting older, and...
maybe our bodies aren't working--

1613
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:02,654
Fuck feedback.
I don't want any feedback right now.

1614
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,823
-Okay.
-I need to make some big changes.

1615
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:06,241
Number one...

1616
01:19:07,492 --> 01:19:08,744
I'm in a shitty marriage.

1617
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:13,373
Brian is a world-class ding-dong.

1618
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:16,918
Thank God.

1619
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:19,504
Brian sucks.

1620
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:22,716
Hey, what's going on in here?

1621
01:19:23,675 --> 01:19:25,844
Rebecca threw her back out,
and Brian sucks.

1622
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,471
What? No.

1623
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:28,972
Val, she knows.

1624
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:31,516
-Thank God.
-Yeah, we don't like him.

1625
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,852
-Such an asshole.
-I'm done lying to myself.

1626
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:36,021
I'm ready to tell it like it is.

1627
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:37,814
It's just like Lady Sunshine said.

1628
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:40,567
It is later than we think, so--

1629
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,820
Okay. Get me up off this floor.

1630
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:48,492
'Cause we are gonna do everything
on that goddamn itinerary,

1631
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:50,160
and we are gonna do it now!

1632
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:52,788
This is really good news,
'cause I have planned exciting things.

1633
01:19:52,871 --> 01:19:55,290
Where's Catherine?
Has anyone seen her this morning?

1634
01:19:55,373 --> 01:19:59,044
Oh, my God, did she leave early
to do that stupid-ass cooking show?

1635
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:01,505
Unbelievable, she full-on bailed
on Rebecca's birthday.

1636
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:05,133
-Oh, happy birthday by the way.
-Happy birthday!

1637
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:06,593
Load me up!

1638
01:20:06,843 --> 01:20:07,928
-Okay.
-Let's go!

1639
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:10,055
-You all right?
-Go! Move!

1640
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:11,890
-Okay, don't--
-Get me out of this bathrobe, though.

1641
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:15,018
It's really depressing.
Put me in my finest muumuu!

1642
01:20:16,853 --> 01:20:19,022
Hey! Good news.

1643
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:21,107
Two hours and counting on the paella.

1644
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:23,902
How in God's name
is that paella not ready?

1645
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:26,112
I got a little sidetracked last night.

1646
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:28,573
-Stop.
-Okay, you know what? It's fine.

1647
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:31,743
-We don't even want the paella.
-No, I can't wait to taste it, Devon.

1648
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:34,162
No, let's not bullshit him.
We don't want the paella.

1649
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:36,957
Life is too short to wait for the paella!

1650
01:20:37,749 --> 01:20:41,670
Ladies, we are gonna grab this day
by the motherfucking balls.

1651
01:20:41,753 --> 01:20:44,965
I'm gonna get this wheely chair
onto this senior van,

1652
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:48,343
-and I'm going to my birthday brunch!
-Yeah! All right, let's do it!

1653
01:20:48,426 --> 01:20:49,427
Let's move it! Yeah!

1654
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:51,596
I feel every bump.

1655
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,348
-Oh, okay, sorry.
-Okay, no, it's all right.

1656
01:20:56,059 --> 01:20:57,394
My work here is done.

1657
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:01,898
Okay, are you ready?

1658
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:05,694
-Lay it on me. Big five-oh.
-Okay, here we go.

1659
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:07,863
-Keep your eyes closed.
-Okay.

1660
01:21:10,323 --> 01:21:13,243
<i>Happy, happy birthday</i>
<i>It's your special day</i>

1661
01:21:13,326 --> 01:21:16,246
<i>Have a slice of pizza</i>
<i>What's your favorite way? Hey!</i>

1662
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:19,332
This is like end of <i>A League of Their Own</i>

1663
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,877
where the baseball ladies show up
at the hall of fame.

1664
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,044
So, check it out.

1665
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:25,881
I just want to show you what I--
what we did. Okay.

1666
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:28,466
We got the original sign from Antonio's.

1667
01:21:29,092 --> 01:21:30,844
It says "Happy birthday, Rebecca."

1668
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:32,762
There's pictures of us.
These are the prices...

1669
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:33,680
Oh, my God.

1670
01:21:33,763 --> 01:21:35,390
...that we had
when we were waiting tables.

1671
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:37,601
Here is the mural
that somebody did a copy of.

1672
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:39,436
But what's different about the face?

1673
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:45,483
-You didn't! How did you do that?
-We had Antonio's pizza flown in.

1674
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:47,360
-And these...
-Oh, my God.

1675
01:21:47,485 --> 01:21:50,655
...are the original bread baskets we used.
And everyone can take one of these home.

1676
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,198
Wow. That is--

1677
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:54,576
Okay, so, Antonio could not be with us
'cause he's dead.

1678
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:57,954
But we have our DJ dressed up
like Antonio,

1679
01:21:58,038 --> 01:22:00,582
and he is ready to get this party started!

1680
01:22:21,394 --> 01:22:23,104
Well, doesn't this look fun.

1681
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,066
-Catherine!
-Cut it!

1682
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:28,151
Catherine! Hey! Catherine!

1683
01:22:28,526 --> 01:22:30,111
Sorry, we thought you left.

1684
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:31,738
I have a shirt for you.

1685
01:22:31,863 --> 01:22:35,075
-Did you guys even notice that I was gone?
-We tried to contact you.

1686
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:37,702
-The Wi-Fi here is...
-The password is so long.

1687
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:40,205
I shouldn't have even come on this trip.
I'm clearly not wanted.

1688
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:41,998
I mean,
and Abby, can you just be honest?

1689
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:44,584
Did you get a five-bedroom
because I wasn't really invited?

1690
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:48,046
What? No.
I honestly thought Jenny wouldn't show.

1691
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:50,382
-Same.
-Whatever, I don't care anymore.

1692
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:53,343
Don't worry,
you clearly won't notice that I'm gone.

1693
01:22:56,888 --> 01:22:57,764
Wow.

1694
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:00,058
Hey, cut it.

1695
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:02,477
I thought she was clapping.

1696
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,021
-It was a slow clap.
-She's clapping sarcastically.

1697
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:07,607
Wait, who's talking? I can't see.
What's happening?

1698
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:10,402
-Okay, what's going on here?
-Oh, what's going on here

1699
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:12,946
is I threw my back out 'cause I'm old.

1700
01:23:13,029 --> 01:23:14,948
Oh, my God, Rebecca, you are not old.

1701
01:23:15,031 --> 01:23:18,910
Oh, please, just don't throw the word
"vivacious" at me or I will lose it.

1702
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:22,789
Naomi, what is with the slow clap?

1703
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:24,332
Oh, I am just applauding

1704
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:27,043
the greatest self-fulfilling prophecy
of all time.

1705
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:28,461
What are you talking about?

1706
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:31,464
You always think that you're not invited
or we leave you out.

1707
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:32,924
So you bury yourself in your work,

1708
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:36,928
but then, you're so buried in your work
that you <i>are </i>left out.

1709
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:40,306
I'm busy, okay? I can't just take off work
whenever I feel like it,

1710
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:43,101
and I shouldn't have to apologize
for being successful.

1711
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:47,147
We are not asking you to apologize
for being successful.

1712
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,524
I'm proud as fuck of you!

1713
01:23:49,899 --> 01:23:53,778
But have you ever considered
that we might really need you here?

1714
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:56,823
We all need all of us here.

1715
01:23:56,906 --> 01:23:59,659
I need to know that we're all gonna
be there for each other,

1716
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:01,786
because this group is sacred to me

1717
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:05,457
And if we can't get
through a weekend together,

1718
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,377
well, then I'm completely lost.

1719
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:14,132
I am going through a really hard time,
and...

1720
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:16,342
I... You know what?

1721
01:24:16,676 --> 01:24:18,094
God, fuck it!

1722
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:20,096
Fuck!

1723
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,183
Fuck. DJ, play that fucking song!

1724
01:24:23,933 --> 01:24:24,809
Cut it.

1725
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:27,270
What hard time?

1726
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:33,443
I finally took the BRCA gene test.

1727
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:34,944
And my results came back,

1728
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:38,490
and I'm too afraid to call
because I'm not ready to hear

1729
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:40,617
that I'm dying of breast cancer. Okay?

1730
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:45,413
My God.

1731
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:58,093
Why isn't anybody telling anybody shit?

1732
01:24:58,176 --> 01:24:59,928
Because Lady Sunshine was right.

1733
01:25:00,053 --> 01:25:01,387
No, she wasn't.

1734
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:04,516
Maybe I should go after her.

1735
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:08,103
There's a slideshow coming up that
I think's gonna really lift her spirits.

1736
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:12,023
Abby, do you really think a slideshow
is gonna make her fears go away?

1737
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,651
What? I don't know. Maybe.

1738
01:25:15,151 --> 01:25:17,987
Look, Rebecca.
I'm just trying to fix this birthday

1739
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:21,366
so you can have fun, okay?
Why is this so difficult?

1740
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:25,537
All right, Abby,
let's get real here, okay?

1741
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:29,332
You got fired, right?
And this planning this birthday

1742
01:25:29,415 --> 01:25:32,085
is probably the first sense of control
you've had in years.

1743
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:35,463
That's totally okay,
but you asked me over and over

1744
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:38,007
what I wanted for my birthday,
but you didn't listen.

1745
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:40,301
So let's stop pretending
that this weekend is about me

1746
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:42,387
because it's all about you.

1747
01:25:52,021 --> 01:25:53,148
Don't come after me.

1748
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:56,151
I'm not coming after you.
This is a dual storm out.

1749
01:25:56,234 --> 01:25:58,194
Where are we going? Do you see them?

1750
01:25:58,736 --> 01:26:00,071
Naomi, stop.

1751
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,115
Leave me alone. I want to be by myself.

1752
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:04,075
I wanna be by myself!

1753
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:08,413
Naomi, wait, you're not dying.

1754
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:09,956
You're gonna be fine.

1755
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:12,792
Really? How do you know, Val?
What are you, an oracle?

1756
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,294
Are your eyeballs a mammogram?

1757
01:26:14,377 --> 01:26:16,462
You just scan me,
and you know I'm gonna be fine?

1758
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:19,215
I don't know, okay?
I'm trying to be a nice person.

1759
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:21,718
Can I ask you something?
Why did you tip Lady Sunshine?

1760
01:26:22,302 --> 01:26:25,680
She charged, like, $500
to tell all of us that we sucked.

1761
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:29,017
I can tip whoever the hell I want
as much as I want.

1762
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,435
I'm a grown-ass woman.

1763
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:33,062
Good. Go tip the whole world.
See how that works for you.

1764
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:34,898
This is a nightmare.

1765
01:26:35,231 --> 01:26:36,524
Then go home, Jenny.

1766
01:26:36,649 --> 01:26:38,109
We all know you want to.

1767
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:41,529
All weekend, all these withering glances,
making me feel like two cents.

1768
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:44,741
Well, what do you want?
A round of applause for most planning?

1769
01:26:44,824 --> 01:26:47,160
Naomi, be a grown-up and call your doctor.

1770
01:26:47,785 --> 01:26:49,621
You are acting like a millennial.

1771
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:50,955
How dare--

1772
01:26:51,998 --> 01:26:53,291
-Something bit me!
-What did?

1773
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:55,001
Oh, my God! A snake.

1774
01:26:55,084 --> 01:26:56,419
What?

1775
01:26:56,502 --> 01:26:58,254
-Oh, my God!
-No!

1776
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:01,382
-Someone tell me what's happening!
-Naomi got bit by a snake!

1777
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:02,926
Oh, my God, it's like the cards.

1778
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:06,095
-Old rocks, snakes.
-Oh, my God, it's happening.

1779
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:09,641
Lady Sunshine was for real.
I bet if we looked it up on the internet,

1780
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:11,643
we'd find out that she's been dead
for 50 years.

1781
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:14,979
Oh, my God, my leg is seizing up! Fuck!

1782
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:17,774
Everybody, stay really calm.
We need to elevate it. We need to ice it.

1783
01:27:17,857 --> 01:27:19,692
We need to call 911. We're gonna call 911.

1784
01:27:19,776 --> 01:27:22,195
We're calling 911.
Fuck me, there's no signal.

1785
01:27:22,278 --> 01:27:24,989
-Fucking never service.
-Does anyone have a hot spot?

1786
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:26,658
Does anyone know how to get it brighter?

1787
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:29,077
-I just took three pictures.
-...then look for brightness...

1788
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:33,164
-My phone is so slow.
-Oh, my God, I'm gonna die!

1789
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:35,625
No, you're not gonna die, Naomi.

1790
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:38,670
You're not gonna die, and you know why?
'Cause I'm going to get help.

1791
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:40,505
Val 2.0!

1792
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:42,799
Val!

1793
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:45,260
Oh, my God!

1794
01:27:47,053 --> 01:27:49,973
Shit!
It sounds like Val's getting smaller!

1795
01:27:54,143 --> 01:27:54,978
Wait!

1796
01:27:55,853 --> 01:27:57,605
-Wait!
-What's going on?

1797
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:00,441
-What was that?
-Val fell down the hill.

1798
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:04,070
-I'm going.
-What? You're going?

1799
01:28:04,153 --> 01:28:05,446
Wait, Jenny's going?

1800
01:28:06,322 --> 01:28:07,740
Someone's gotta help her.

1801
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:09,534
Why don't we just go back
the way we came in?

1802
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:11,786
No! Hell no! There's snakes back there.

1803
01:28:12,578 --> 01:28:14,664
-No, Jenny!
-What's happening?

1804
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:17,417
-Jenny?
-Jenny, no!

1805
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:21,254
Jenny? Oh, my God, how is she not falling?

1806
01:28:21,587 --> 01:28:22,880
Hey, Jenny!

1807
01:28:23,339 --> 01:28:25,675
Wow. Did she ski as a kid?

1808
01:28:28,052 --> 01:28:29,637
Man, she's keeping that wine safe.

1809
01:28:32,098 --> 01:28:33,308
I am not gonna die

1810
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:35,893
of a poisonous snake bite
on the top of this hill.

1811
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:38,146
Not today, Satan! I got this.

1812
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:39,314
What?

1813
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:42,817
-I'm going!
-Okay, now, Naomi's going.

1814
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:46,654
Help me out of this cart,
I need to go down the hill.

1815
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:49,824
What about your back?

1816
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:52,952
-You know what? It's my birthday.
-Oh, God.

1817
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:56,914
And I'm not gonna lay here
and watch the fucking clouds go by.

1818
01:28:57,081 --> 01:28:59,876
Now, get me off this cart.

1819
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:01,377
Hold on.

1820
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:04,339
-Naomi, you can do it!
-There's wine down here!

1821
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:05,798
Go!

1822
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:10,762
-Oh, boy.
-Oh, cripes.

1823
01:29:13,973 --> 01:29:15,433
-No...
-Jump!

1824
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:16,351
Naomi!

1825
01:29:17,226 --> 01:29:18,061
Fuck!

1826
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:22,065
Is everybody okay?

1827
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:25,068
Oh, my God.

1828
01:29:26,152 --> 01:29:27,570
That fixed my back!

1829
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:29,822
Oh, God!

1830
01:29:33,117 --> 01:29:34,410
I'm gonna take the easy way.

1831
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:38,039
-You did it. That was crazy.
-We did it.

1832
01:29:38,122 --> 01:29:39,165
Oh, my God.

1833
01:29:39,582 --> 01:29:41,376
Easy.

1834
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:45,421
Just get to the bush,
and you're fine from there.

1835
01:29:45,671 --> 01:29:46,631
That's what she said.

1836
01:29:51,427 --> 01:29:54,055
Just let go! We're here for you!

1837
01:29:54,263 --> 01:29:55,431
You got this, Abby.

1838
01:29:55,515 --> 01:29:58,226
-I'm gonna let go!
-You can do it!

1839
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:02,397
You're braving the wilderness, Abby!

1840
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:09,362
-You got it! Yeah!
-Of course I'm the last one left.

1841
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:11,197
Oh, my God.

1842
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,784
Hello? Oh, hi!

1843
01:30:15,284 --> 01:30:17,036
Hi! The whole team's there. Hi, guys!

1844
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,163
-Cath, come on!
-Yeah!

1845
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:20,248
Great, go ahead.

1846
01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:23,000
Are you kidding me? She's taking a call?

1847
01:30:23,709 --> 01:30:24,544
Okay.

1848
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:28,798
So you're saying that you think
I would be stupid to pass on this offer.

1849
01:30:30,716 --> 01:30:32,802
Well, I'm gonna be stupid. I'm gonna pass.

1850
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:36,431
You know what? Life is just going
by me faster than I thought it would,

1851
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:39,100
and I'm tired
of chasing the next big thing.

1852
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:41,519
I-- It's kept me from living
in the present.

1853
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:44,981
Okay, I'm gonna hang up
before I change my mind.

1854
01:30:50,736 --> 01:30:53,030
In case you're wondering,
I said no to the job!

1855
01:30:53,406 --> 01:30:55,491
-What is she saying?
-We can't hear you!

1856
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:58,369
I wanna be able to go on vacation,
you know?

1857
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:06,335
I'm so sorry, we can't hear you!

1858
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:09,005
But here's the thing you do have to know
about me.

1859
01:31:09,088 --> 01:31:10,631
I love working.

1860
01:31:10,923 --> 01:31:12,383
I do. I love it.

1861
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:15,845
But I'm gonna come down there.

1862
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:18,306
I'm coming down now,

1863
01:31:19,056 --> 01:31:20,475
because I choose you.

1864
01:31:21,184 --> 01:31:23,060
-I mean, should we nod?
-I can't hear a word.

1865
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:24,061
I didn't get one word of that.

1866
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:27,607
Adrian, comma, send ambulance
to Sacred Moon Winery, period.

1867
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:30,234
Friend bitten by snake, exclamation point,
question mark.

1868
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:32,195
Snake emoji. Send.

1869
01:31:47,251 --> 01:31:49,337
Swan dive maybe wasn't the best idea.

1870
01:31:49,962 --> 01:31:51,589
Gonna feel that one tomorrow.

1871
01:31:55,134 --> 01:31:56,552
But it was glorious.

1872
01:31:57,678 --> 01:31:58,513
Thanks.

1873
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:04,435
Okay, so the snake wasn't venomous.

1874
01:32:05,478 --> 01:32:08,272
We treated it
with some antibacterial cream, and...

1875
01:32:09,148 --> 01:32:10,024
you're all good.

1876
01:32:11,317 --> 01:32:14,570
Well, I'm definitely not all good.

1877
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:16,906
Little condescending.

1878
01:32:16,989 --> 01:32:20,993
So, we almost died on that hill
because of a <i>non</i>-venomous snake?

1879
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:23,704
Yeah, you know, honestly, I think
it might have been a sharp twig.

1880
01:32:25,164 --> 01:32:26,958
Sometimes those catch you
at the wrong angle.

1881
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:29,335
No, it was a snake. We saw a snake.

1882
01:32:29,418 --> 01:32:31,045
Also, I'm a grown woman.

1883
01:32:31,128 --> 01:32:33,631
I think I know when I've been bit
by a snake.

1884
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:35,800
Let me guess, Dr. Dickswing,

1885
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:37,468
it's because of her period.

1886
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:39,971
That's the problem with the medical
establishment, no one listens to women.

1887
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:43,516
Right. This is why more women die
of heart attacks, right here.

1888
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:45,851
Also, I don't appreciate it

1889
01:32:45,935 --> 01:32:48,938
when you grin at me
while giving me my results.

1890
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:50,398
'Cause I could have died.

1891
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:52,066
When I get home,

1892
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:55,111
and if there <i>is </i>venom in my ankle,

1893
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:58,948
I'm gonna come back here
and make sure you personally suck it out.

1894
01:32:59,031 --> 01:32:59,991
-Yeah.
-Suck it.

1895
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:02,368
I'm not entirely sure
what's happening here.

1896
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:04,954
-Thank you, that'll be all.
-Okay, thank you.

1897
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:09,041
Also, tell your mom to pick you up
after your shift, Doogie!

1898
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:11,335
Fucking dickweed.

1899
01:33:12,086 --> 01:33:12,962
So should we...

1900
01:33:14,797 --> 01:33:16,299
head on back to the house?

1901
01:33:19,302 --> 01:33:20,386
We need to make a call.

1902
01:33:27,852 --> 01:33:28,894
Call doctor...?

1903
01:33:30,396 --> 01:33:31,314
Melton.

1904
01:33:33,649 --> 01:33:34,817
Call Dr. Melton.

1905
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:38,529
<i>Hello, Dr. Melton's office.</i>

1906
01:33:38,821 --> 01:33:40,364
Hi, this is Naomi Reid.

1907
01:33:40,531 --> 01:33:43,034
I'm calling for the results
of my BRCA test.

1908
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:46,954
<i>Yes, let me get the results for you.</i>
<i>Let me put you on a brief hold, okay?</i>

1909
01:33:47,371 --> 01:33:48,205
Yeah.

1910
01:33:49,248 --> 01:33:51,000
That was a really good Naomi.

1911
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:57,673
No matter what this news is,
we got you, okay?

1912
01:34:02,219 --> 01:34:03,179
<i>Hi, Mrs. Reid?</i>

1913
01:34:04,013 --> 01:34:06,057
<i>Hi, yes, your blood work</i>
<i>came back negative.</i>

1914
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:08,809
Thank you.

1915
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:13,481
Thank you so much.

1916
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:16,192
And what were the results of my fart test?

1917
01:34:20,446 --> 01:34:21,614
I don't have it.

1918
01:34:22,948 --> 01:34:23,824
Hey, Janiece.

1919
01:34:24,533 --> 01:34:26,994
How's your son? Still on the chess team?

1920
01:34:27,078 --> 01:34:30,206
-Oh, yeah, big nerd.
-It's the only way to raise 'em.

1921
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:32,166
Hey, Tammy's here.

1922
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:34,168
How'd you know where we were at?

1923
01:34:34,293 --> 01:34:36,796
Well, I heard on the scanner
that six middle-aged ladies

1924
01:34:36,879 --> 01:34:39,006
went to the ER.
Figured it had to be you guys.

1925
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:45,471
So, do you still want me to call
that taxi for you?

1926
01:34:46,138 --> 01:34:48,641
No. My friend will drive us.

1927
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,560
Did not know we were using the f-word.

1928
01:34:52,603 --> 01:34:54,563
I am deleting Jade.

1929
01:34:55,564 --> 01:34:56,941
I'm too cool for her, I think.

1930
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:58,317
-Indeed.
-Poor thing.

1931
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:01,529
Well, at least you got a great painting
of the Nanny out of the deal.

1932
01:35:01,612 --> 01:35:03,698
What did that cost you? Like, 50 bucks?

1933
01:35:04,156 --> 01:35:05,032
Yeah, about that.

1934
01:35:05,116 --> 01:35:08,160
-Let me take that plant off your hands.
-You deserve it, Janiece.

1935
01:35:08,285 --> 01:35:10,162
Okay, come on, truck's out front.

1936
01:35:10,871 --> 01:35:12,707
What happened to you guys anyway?

1937
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:15,751
-Fell down a hill.
-Seems about right.

1938
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:43,279
-Thank you, Tammy.
<i>-De nada.</i> Now...

1939
01:35:43,487 --> 01:35:47,032
I'm just gonna remind you
to ping-pong between water and wine

1940
01:35:47,116 --> 01:35:49,034
because that helps with the hangover.

1941
01:35:49,326 --> 01:35:52,037
Oh, is that... the things we say now?

1942
01:35:52,121 --> 01:35:53,205
Absolutely.

1943
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:55,708
-Good job, Tammy!
-Oh, good one, Tammy!

1944
01:35:55,791 --> 01:35:58,586
-I'm gonna let you guys get to it.
-Tammy, stay and hang with us.

1945
01:35:58,669 --> 01:36:02,131
-No, that's all right.
-Yeah! Sit right there.

1946
01:36:02,214 --> 01:36:03,132
Come have some fun.

1947
01:36:03,215 --> 01:36:05,676
-Park it. Drop your can.
-Park your pooter.

1948
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,679
-Thank you very much.
-All right, ladies, I just want to say...

1949
01:36:09,138 --> 01:36:10,681
thank you for a great birthday.

1950
01:36:11,307 --> 01:36:13,476
Rebecca. Happy birthday to Rebecca.

1951
01:36:13,559 --> 01:36:17,730
-Come on, give it to me! All about me!
-Rebecca!

1952
01:36:17,813 --> 01:36:19,648
-Happy birthday, love you.
-Cheers.

1953
01:36:19,982 --> 01:36:20,983
Cheers.

1954
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:24,862
Oh, my God.

1955
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:26,864
-Oh, wow.
-It's cool, right?

1956
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:29,742
Abby, did you plan this?

1957
01:36:30,409 --> 01:36:31,744
I love it!

1958
01:36:32,578 --> 01:36:33,996
I'm so glad you like it.

1959
01:36:43,255 --> 01:36:44,423
Guys, I fucked Devon.

1960
01:36:45,341 --> 01:36:47,134
-What?
-Excuse me?

1961
01:36:47,718 --> 01:36:50,304
I fucked Devon. I had sex with him.
I fucked Devon.

1962
01:36:51,055 --> 01:36:52,723
-Paella Devon?
-Yeah.

1963
01:36:54,433 --> 01:36:55,976
Oh, my God.

1964
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:58,395
This is mind-blowing.

1965
01:36:59,021 --> 01:37:00,648
-Was it good?
-Oh, yeah.

1966
01:37:00,856 --> 01:37:01,732
Dang.

1967
01:37:02,149 --> 01:37:04,401
Ew, they're cheersing to it.

1968
01:37:05,528 --> 01:37:06,695
Oh, my God.

1969
01:37:07,154 --> 01:37:09,323
-I, too, fucked Devon.
-What?

1970
01:37:10,699 --> 01:37:12,493
-No.
-Yeah, I did.

1971
01:37:12,576 --> 01:37:14,954
-Don't do that right now.
-Did everybody fuck Devon?

1972
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:17,122
Did I fuck Devon?

1973
01:37:17,748 --> 01:37:19,792
Guess he really did come with the house.

1974
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:24,797
-Oh, Tammy liked that one!
-Okay.

1975
01:37:25,881 --> 01:37:28,133
You know,
I'm really glad I came on this trip.

1976
01:37:28,592 --> 01:37:29,760
Oh, my God.

1977
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:32,638
I love you guys.

1978
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:11,922
<i>Are we singing that last part wrong,</i>
<i>or are we singing--</i>

1979
01:40:12,006 --> 01:40:14,008
<i>-I beefed it so many times.</i>
<i>-I beefed it many times.</i>
