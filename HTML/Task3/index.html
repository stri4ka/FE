            <p>Most wine is made with grapes, but they're not like the ones you find in the grocery store. 
                Wine grapes (latin name: <mark> Vitis vinifera</mark>) are smaller, sweeter, have thick skins, and contain seeds. 
                There are over 1,300 wine grape varieties used in commercial production but only about 100 
                of these varieties make up 75% of the world's vineyards.
                Today, the most planted wine grape in the world is Cabernet Sauvignon 
                (<bdi>"cab-err-nay saw-vin-yon"</bdi>). <wbr>Find out more about the basics of wine

                With hundreds of varieties of red wine grapes, there is as much red wine information to learn about as 
                there are red grapes planted in all corners of the globe. That being said, you’ll likely encounter only a handful of 
                these grapes most often. Here, we cover the flavor profiles and regions of the most common red wine grapes. 
                You can certainly choose to discover more beyond this short list, but for a quick and easy red wine 101, 
                the following will fit the bill.

                <h3>Red Wine Styles</h3>
                <label for="saturation">Saturation:</label>

                <p>As with all wines, the particular winemaker will have adequate “say” in the style of wine he will produce. That said, 
                    red wines are often classified by “body-type.” For example, one might say that a certain red wine is “light-bodied” – 
                    referring to the mouth-feel and tannin structure.
                    A light-bodied wine will have fewer tannins present and less presence on the palate. 
                    These wines tend to be less demanding partners with flavor-filled foods. An example of a light-bodied red wine would be
                    derived from the Gamay grape varietal, such as France’s famed young red wine: Beaujolais Nouveau.                        
                    A medium-bodied red wine will contain more tannins than the above Beaujolais Nouveau, but will not have near the 
                    pucker power of a high-powered California Cabernet Sauvignon or an Italian Super Tuscan. 
                    Typical examples of medium-bodied red wines include Merlot, Shiraz or a Chianti.                        
                    Full-bodied red wines boast the highest tannin (and often alcohol) content. Prime examples of full-bodied reds are 
                    France’s esteemed Bordeaux wines, California’s key Cabs and Italy’s sizzling Super Tuscans. In general, 
                    light-bodied wines tend to “feel” more like water in the mouth. In contrast, “full-bodied” wines feel heavier, 
                    more like milk. This effect is due in large part to the higher tannin (and again, alcohol) content. 
                    Red wines are also often described as either dry or sweet.
